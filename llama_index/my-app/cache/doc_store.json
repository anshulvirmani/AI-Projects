As someone who has \\r\\nbeen consulting in open source for almost 15 years, I’ve seen a lot of what \\r\\nworks and what doesn’t, as well as lots of trial and especially error.

FROM THE FIRST EDITION\\r\\nFROM ANTS TO ANTEATERS, bees to beekeepers, community is a fundamental part of our life\\r\\non the planet. We thrive when we are immersed in it, suffer when deprived of it, and wherever\\r\\nhumans go we create it. We define ourselves by our communities: tribe, family, work, clubs,\\r\\nschools, churches and temples, these are who we are. We are born into community, and if\\r\\nwe’re lucky we’ll end our days surrounded by it. It’s no surprise that as soon as humans began to go online, communities formed, but as easy\\r\\nand natural as group formation is for us in real life, we can find it frustrating online. Many of\\r\\nthe cues that grease the wheels of human interaction in person are missing online. Gone is the\\r\\ngrin that can soften a criticism, the pat on the back that can heal a rift. How can you “hug it\\r\\nout” when your antagonist is a continent away and you know no more about him than his\\r\\nhandle and a few lines of signature? Online groups can breed the most vicious of rivalries. The\\r\\nHatfields and McCoys have nothing on alt.tv.doctorwho. Communities are tough enough to maintain when you’re all in the same room; how much\\r\\nharder is it to build, maintain, and nurture a community online?

It’s not easy to start a flame war with dual 14.4 kbps\\r\\nmodems and 20 MB of storage, but the MacQueuers managed. A few years later I joined The\\r\\nWell, a legendary online community based in Sausalito, California, and imbued with the peace\\r\\nand love ethos of the San Francisco hippies. That didn’t last long. The Well went through an\\r\\narc I came to know intimately, one that most online communities seem to follow. When any affinity group forms online it’s a joyous occasion. The founders and early members\\r\\nare wreathed in the cooperative enthusiasm that accompanies most new beginnings. Conversations are civil, helpful, and kind. Posts twinkle with good spirits and bonhomie. All’s\\r\\nright with the Web. Then the rot begins to set in. Tempers flare, resentments build, rivalries\\r\\nform. It’s a lot like marriage. Unlike most marriages, however, online members have looser ties to the group and a reduced\\r\\nstake in its success. When trolls become annoying, the flame wars too fiery, members move\\r\\non, and pretty soon that happy online forum turns into a ghost town, or worse. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With his usual wit and good humor, Jono has written a\\r\\nguide with everything you need to keep your online groups healthy and productive. With\\r\\nproper planning, a modicum of guidance, and the occasional banishment, your community\\r\\ncan avoid that seemingly inevitable descent into fear and loathing. We need good community\\r\\nmanagers because we need healthy communities online. I’ve started my share of communities\\r\\nonline, and killed a few with neglect, too.

Here more than\\r\\n20,000 members collaborate to make open source unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which\\r\\nare essentially fully autonomous airplanes, helicopters, and other things with spinning\\r\\npropellers that fly all by themselves. The DIY Drones community has created countless products, but the most successful is\\r\\nArduPilot, a series of autopilots based on the Arduino computing platform. We’re part of the\\r\\nOpen Hardware movement, which is to say that there is both a software and a hardware\\r\\nelement to the autopilots our community creates, and both are open source. Although I and\\r\\nothers also have commercial companies that make and sell this hardware (mine is called 3D\\r\\nRobotics), under the terms of the open source license, anybody, absolutely anybody, can use\\r\\nthe designs our community creates and make them to compete with us. It may sound crazy,\\r\\nbut such openness can create innovations faster, cheaper, and better than traditional closed\\r\\nsource research and design in regular companies. The only risk is that some other company\\r\\nwill clone the product and sell it for less, fully within the legal terms of the license. This is exactly what happened in late 2010. We got word that Chinese copies of our ArduPilot\\r\\nMega design were for sale on Taobao, eBay, and other online marketplaces. And indeed they\\r\\nwere—well-produced, fully functional clones. Not only that, but our English instruction\\r\\nmanual had been translated into Chinese, too, along with some of the software.

Software, which costs nothing\\r\\nto distribute, is free.

All intellectual property is open, so the\\r\\ncommunity can use it, improve it, make their own variants, etc. The possibility that others would clone the products is built into the model. It’s specifically\\r\\nallowed by our open source license. Ideally, people would change/improve the products\\r\\n(\\\"derivative designs\\\") to address market needs that they perceive and we have not addressed. That’s the sort of innovation that open source is designed to promote. But if they only clone the\\r\\nproducts and sell them at lower prices, that’s okay, too. The marketplace will decide. BTW, the Arduino development boards have gone through exactly the same situation, with\\r\\nmany Chinese cloners. The clones were sometimes of lower quality, but even when they were\\r\\ngood, most people continued to support the official Arduino products and the developers that\\r\\ncreated them. Today, clones have a small share of the market, mostly in very price-sensitive\\r\\nmarkets such as China. And frankly, being able to reach a lower-price market is a form of\\r\\ninnovation, too, and that is no bad thing. Personally, I’m delighted to see this development, for four reasons:\\r\\n1.I think it’s great that people have translated the wiki into Chinese, which makes it accessible\\r\\nto more people. 2. It’s a sign of success—you only get cloned if you’re making something people want. 3. Competition is good. 4. What starts as clones may eventually become real innovation and improvements. Remember that our licence requires that any derivative designs must also be open source. Think how great would it be if a Chinese team created a better design than ours.

We cover the underlying nuts and bolts of how people form communities, what\\r\\nkeeps them involved, and the basis and opportunities behind these interactions. Chapter 2, Planning Your Community\\r\\nNext we carve out and document a blueprint and strategy for your community and its\\r\\nfuture growth. Part of this strategy includes the target objectives and goals and how the\\r\\ncommunity can be structured to achieve them.

In this chapter we build simple, effective, and nonbureaucratic processes that\\r\\nenable your community to conduct tasks, work together, and share their successes. Chapter 5, Supporting Workflow with Tools and Data\\r\\nWe continue our discussion of community facilities to build workflows that are driven by\\r\\naccessible, sensible, and rock-solid tools that enable your contributors to do great work\\r\\nquickly and easily. Chapter 6, Social Media\\r\\nWe now take a look at social networking, what it is, how it can help us, how to avoid the\\r\\nhype, and how to harness it in our communities. Chapter 7, Building Buzz\\r\\nWith a solid foundation in place, we move on to build excitement and buzz around your\\r\\ncommunity and encourage and enthuse every man and his dog to get involved and\\r\\nparticipate. Chapter 8, Measuring Community\\r\\nAlthough many consider community touchy-feely and unmeasurable, this chapter\\r\\nconfronts the myth and guides you in tracking, monitoring, and otherwise measuring the\\r\\nwork going on in the community so that it can be optimized and simplified.

We explore\\r\\nwhat options are available for a low-friction, capable, and representative governance\\r\\nstrategy for your community. Chapter 11, Handling Conflict and Relationships\\r\\nOne of the most sensitive topics in community leadership is handling conflict. In this\\r\\nchapter we explore how to identify, handle, and prevent irksome conflict; handle divisive\\r\\npersonalities; and unblock problems.

First of all, I was late, and\\r\\nnot fashionably late either. In fact, at the time, I was about as unfashionable as you could get\\r\\nfor someone staring 18 down the barrel. Long hair, Iron Maiden t-shirt, baggy camouflage\\r\\ntrousers, and a thumping-great leather jacket. I left my parents’ house and got into my small\\r\\nvan, adorned with oversized speakers and a tree-shaped air freshener. It was time to roll. “Rolling” was optimistic. Instead, I sat bumper-to-bumper in traffic with half of Southern\\r\\nEngland, all joined in curiosity about whether or not that film with Michael Douglas could\\r\\nbecome a reality on this cold English day. This wasn’t helping my nerves. As a fairly outgoing, angsty teen, nerves were not usually my\\r\\nbag, but tonight, I was dining on them. You see, tonight was different. Tonight I was doing something unusual, something that had\\r\\nseemed like a great idea...when I wasn’t running 30 minutes late, hammering my way down\\r\\nthe motorway, with my Number of the Beast cassette ritualistically sacrificed to the gods of hi-fi\\r\\njust for good measure. Thankfully, the world’s longest mechanical conga line decided to crank it up a notch. Before\\r\\nI knew it, I found myself on a street I had never been to, in a city I had never been to, about\\r\\nto head into a room full of people I had never met before, all united by one simple symbol... 1\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"714e46ca-e1b7-4f42-8a32-a674077e0192":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"714e46ca-e1b7-4f42-8a32-a674077e0192\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"Tly79BkaYytDj8Z2/95i7a6uqOYe+oTBHOyWwvSMysI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qxTBFbg477PElwA2QGecffnEAPNyRxwRtPWx7kNlFcg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"bc57fd3a-6f7f-4682-b2e6-508b6312f5cc\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"2gy54Fkfc1ErgUNGdup7yA/NjcQX0lPsOHIOJ3U2mDA=\"}},\"hash\":\"Xg6x8WZW7TdUnTwRbmQowYZA0i7rODWHNsYOkZAGyb0=\",\"text\":\"A penguin. An hour before, that penguin had seemed so inviting and friendly. It was a symbol that\\r\\nencompassed everything about the movement it represented, a movement that came together\\r\\nin spirit and mind to build a system that drove a new generation of technology and freedom... a movement that celebrated this drive by forming user groups in unknown streets, in unknown\\r\\ncities, and with unknown people. But as I stood there, doorbell already pressed, none of that was even close to my conscious\\r\\nthoughts. Instead, the brain of one Jonathan E. J. Bacon was battening down the hatches,\\r\\npreparing for ultimate, unparalleled discomfort as I walked into a place I both did and didn’t\\r\\nwant to be at the same time. Then the door opened and a rather nice chap called Neil welcomed me into his home. Community is a funny beast. Most people—the kind who watch talent shows on television\\r\\nand occasionally dip bread in oil in an expensive restaurant—don’t understand people like\\r\\nNeil. Why on earth would this guy decide to open his home, free of charge, to a collection of\\r\\nstrangers who met on the Internet? Why would he want to spend an evening drinking tea and\\r\\nmaking jokes about something called “Emacs”? And why would he fund online resources like\\r\\nfliers, a mailing list, and a website from his own pocket; start a book-lending service for the\\r\\ngroup—and even shell out for tea and biscuits? One person who really didn’t seem to understand was Neil’s wife. Somewhat bemused, and\\r\\nreferring to us as his “Internet friends,” Neil’s significant other decided tonight was the night\\r\\nfor visiting a long-lost (or possibly ignored) relative, rather than sticking around and faking\\r\\ninterest.

Radio personalities across the world were\\r\\nnot exactly shaking in their boots. Recorded in a very small room that I called a studio, but was actually a bedroom filled\\r\\nwith secondhand recording equipment, LugRadio involved my three compadres and me\\r\\nopining into four precariously balanced microphones that fed into a computer. Episode 1 was\\r\\naround half an hour long, composed of bad jokes and a book review, and totally unpolished. At the time, it was just new and different.

Anyway, enough of the self-\\r\\ncongratulatory back-patting and back to the story.... With the show out, we did what many of us in the open source world do—we set up forums,\\r\\nwikis, and channels, and tried to get people together around our new project. The forums went\\r\\nonline first, and people started joining. The 22nd member was a guy called Ben Thorp, known as mrben on the forums. An Englishman\\r\\nliving in Scotland, mrben was an open source enthusiast who stumbled onto the forums,\\r\\nlistened to the show, and liked what he heard. For the four years that LugRadio lasted, mrben\\r\\nwas there every single day: in total contributing over 3,000 posts; involving himself in the chat\\r\\nchannel, the wiki, and the organization of the live events; running an episode download\\r\\nmirror; and much more.

Grouping, however, is a touch simplistic as a means to describe community. It is not\\r\\nmerely the group that generates community, but the interactions within it. These interactions,\\r\\nand the feeling of belonging that they produce, are generated from a distinctive kind of\\r\\neconomy: a social economy. Building Belonging into the Social Economy\\r\\nAt this point in our journey, it is clear that belonging is our goal.

In the same way that we judge a strong financial\\r\\neconomy by prosperity, wealth, and a quality standard of living, belonging is the reward of a\\r\\nstrong social economy.

Not every market involves exchanging money for goods and services. A\\r\\ngem of an economics book (Reinventing the Bazaar by John McMillan, 2002, p. 135) points out that well-\\r\\ndesigned markets, regardless of market type, have a number of things in common:\\r\\n•Information flows smoothly. •People can be trusted to live up to their promises. •Competition is fostered. •Property rights are protected, but not overprotected. •Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed. Let’s look at well-run free and open source project communities in terms of such market dynamics:\\r\\n•Information flows smoothly—transparency of community, process, code, policy, bugs, discussions. •People can be trusted to live up to their promises—the project’s license is a social contract. Its\\r\\ngovernance culture is well understood and supported. •Competition is fostered—what fixes and features are accepted, and which ones don’t make it. •Property rights are protected, but not overprotected—code copyright management and licensing is\\r\\nhandled properly in well-run projects. •Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed—the point here from the book is that WHEN real\\r\\ndamage might be done to third parties, there are ways governments can involve themselves in the\\r\\nmarket to curtail such effects, whether by defining/enforcing property rights, taxes/incentives, or\\r\\npolicy/regulation. The community’s license comes to mind. Individual projects behave as markets from one perspective, and code is currency, the medium of\\r\\nexchange. Just like all economic exchanges, the contributor offers something they value less (a fragment\\r\\nof code solving a particular need) for something they value more (the functioning software package in its\\r\\nentirety). Nobody is working for free in an economic sense.

The meat in Hanifan’s description is the opportunity for social capital to “bear a social\\r\\npotentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole\\r\\ncommunity. ” In essence, if a member of your community has a positive approach to another\\r\\nmember, her social capital grows, which has a positive impact on that person and the\\r\\ncommunity as a whole. It all sounds a lot like karma, and it is. Of course, capital, whether monetary or social, is not the end game. People don’t make money\\r\\nfor the purposes of just having money. They make money because it allows them to do other\\r\\nthings. This is an important aspect of understanding where an economy starts and ends. Most folks\\r\\nriding the financial economy are not purely greedy numbers freaks who just want a big pot of\\r\\nmoney; most people who work with social capital are not merely air-kissing, hand-waving,\\r\\nsuperficial animals who simply want to name-drop and be name-dropped in the interests of\\r\\nsocial acceptance. Of course, the greedy and the socially obsessed do exist, but it is important\\r\\nnot to use them as a basis for judgment. The economy is not flawed; those people are flawed. A final point: for an economy to work, every participant needs to believe in the economy. Belief\\r\\nis a critical component in how any group of people or animals functions. This can be belief in\\r\\nGod, belief in values, or belief in a new future. Whatever the core belief is, the economy and\\r\\nthe community can be successful only if everyone has faith in it.

We now need to focus on the final\\r\\ncomponent that binds each of these concepts together: communication. In many ways, an economy is like a flowing river: it never stops, and the flow is critical to its\\r\\nsuccess. Economies never stand still. Every day they change, adjusting to stimuli in the world\\r\\nthat affects them. At the heart of how this movement works is communication. The Basis of Communication\\r\\nPeter Bloch, a consultant on learning, makes an important foundational observation about\\r\\ncommunication in a social economy: “Community is fundamentally an interdependent human\\r\\nsystem given form by the conversation it holds with itself. ” When I first heard that quote, I\\r\\nrealized that the mechanism behind communication in a community is stories. Stories are a medium in which we keep the river flowing. They are the vessels not only in\\r\\nwhich we express ideas (“I was taking the subway to work one day, and I saw this lady on\\r\\nthere reading the paper, and it made me think xyz”), but also in how we learn from past\\r\\nexperiences (“There was one time when I saw David do xyz and I knew I had to adjust how I\\r\\nmyself handle those situations in the future”). Furthermore, when the characters in the stories\\r\\nare people in a community, the stories are self-referencing and give the community a sense of\\r\\nreporting. Communities really feel like communities when there is a newswire, be it formalized\\r\\nor through the grapevine. Not all stories are cut from the same cloth, though. Communities tend to exchange two very\\r\\ndifferent kinds of story: tales and fables. Tales are told for entertainment value and to share experiences. They are individual units of\\r\\nexperience that are shared between people, and their primary value is in communicating a\\r\\ngiven person’s experience and adding to the listener’s repertoire of stories and experiences. Fables are different. Fables are stories designed to illustrate an underlying message. The vast\\r\\nmajority of us are exposed to fables as children, and these stories are passed down from\\r\\ngeneration to generation, each one extolling a moral message to the youth of the day.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a54b9edb-1e9e-4663-bce5-99a1f713d187":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a54b9edb-1e9e-4663-bce5-99a1f713d187\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"d3vBYt915D1NlUBxdxdsjcdk4ZsuTKyIMgmsj2Ff/Yk=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"r3zvRcXGA+WiPGy4gu0y3LCUta8EcPFKNVQRKXGUjjg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5dc83097-3eb3-4398-8e24-a41b2cbca564\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"eUzomuEVfUg87vemhIiUsDYjMK6hBdgwkhgqrP1ZXHo=\"}},\"hash\":\"07GSm3GLHx72I9xSUAwTQeyrgE+155pPRKkhOC1oZn8=\",\"text\":\"Let us now take a step back to our earlier story about mrben joining the LugRadio community.

The latter, strategic traits, are skills, perspectives,\\r\\nand abilities that help you to organize complex problems into logical boxes, develop action\\r\\npoints and a plan, and implement those intentions in a controlled way. Strategy is a large and\\r\\ncomplex subject, and we will discuss it extensively in the next chapter. As such, I will defer\\r\\nexploration of this part of the community manager’s brain until later. For now, let’s talk about\\r\\npersonality. My wife and I often joke about how I respond when someone asks me what I do for a living. I used to describe my job as “managing a worldwide community of volunteers,” which sounded\\r\\nrather accurate and complete to me. My wife was less impressed. She rightly nudged me and\\r\\nsuggested that made it sound like I manage a large online forum of very weird Japanese\\r\\nanimation fans with a worrying obsession with tentacles.

The best I have\\r\\ncome up with is:\\r\\nI help to enable a worldwide collection of volunteers to work together to do things that\\r\\nmake a difference to them. I know, it needs work. Send better suggestions to the usual address.... Twenty of those 21 words are really just filler around the word that I truly think describes what\\r\\nwe do: enable. Our function as community leaders is to enable people to be the best they can be in the\\r\\ncommunity they have chosen to be a part of. Our job is to help our community members\\r\\nachieve their greatest ambitions, and to help them work with other members to realize not\\r\\nonly their own personal goals, but also the goals of the community itself. Trust Is Everything\\r\\nAt the heart of this enablement is trust.

Either you are trusted or you are not. As my\\r\\nfather-in-law said to my family one evening over dinner, “Live your life honestly—if you don’t,\\r\\nyou always have to remember to not be yourself. ” His words teach an important lesson: when\\r\\ntrust is implicit in every step you take, you can always be confident in the transparency and\\r\\nopenness of your actions. This is the most important aspect of community leadership, and of\\r\\nlife itself. Part of the reason why trust is so critical is that, as a community leader, you want to be\\r\\nemotionally close to everyone in your community. You want everyone in that community to\\r\\nthink of you as an accessible, approachable, sensitive person, and trust is required for any of\\r\\nthese roles. People will approach you for advice, for guidance, to discuss personal issues, to\\r\\nhandle conflict, and more. Many of these situations will be complex, and will require a\\r\\nsignificant level of sensitivity and confidence. The Value of Listening\\r\\nPart of achieving that sense of trust and confidence is having a firm foundation of\\r\\nunderstanding and patience. You should be aware right now that some people are going to\\r\\nfrustrate you.

As a community leader you will experience all sides of human nature, from strength and\\r\\ninnovation to weakness and uncertainty. Whatever you hear from your community, you\\r\\nshould endeavor to be the best listener that you can. When you can demonstrate trust and the ability to listen, your community will develop respect\\r\\nfor you. They will be there to listen to you, to work with you, to stand side-by-side with you\\r\\nin your battles and become a large extended family that you can rely on.

Unfortunately, ego is\\r\\nsomething that plagues a lot of people who assume a form of leadership. One rather fun side effect of an influential position is fame; people know who you are, they\\r\\nread your words, and they listen to your opinions. The growth of the Internet and online\\r\\ncommunities has made it easier than ever to bolster your ego. Google searches, social\\r\\nnetworking websites, news feeds, alerts, statistics tracking, and more make it easier than ever\\r\\nto find out how many people love (or loathe) you. While this may seem incredibly flattering\\r\\nat times, strive to put your audience in perspective. The world is a big place, and you have\\r\\nsome incredible contributions to add to it, but you should always aim to strike a balance\\r\\nbetween valuing your contributions and disappearing up your own arse. Unfortunately, I have seen ego claim too many victims. I have seen community leaders who\\r\\nhave commanded incredible respect and adoration from their legions of fans, but have washed\\r\\nit away when they assume a sense of entitlement. In any community, entitlement is an enemy:\\r\\nit values the person over the contribution, creating unrealistic expectations about how people\\r\\nshould be treated. People with this sense of entitlement typically identify the wider\\r\\ncontributions of the community, but see their fame as a red carpet that others don’t have access\\r\\nto. You can avoid the wrath of ego by always remembering that in your role as a community\\r\\nleader you are responsible to the team, not for the team.

We sat down with paper and\\r\\npens, and more cups of tea, discussing and debating until 4 a.m. When I got home and dragged\\r\\nmy drained body into bed, my laptop bag contained three pieces of paper outlining an entirely\\r\\nnew approach to audio recording. Despite our brainstorming efforts, I just didn’t have the time or knowledge to write an audio\\r\\neditor. I could have used my meager audio programming and development skills to produce a\\r\\nrather crufty attempt, but it would have been of little use, and I was already intensely busy. Despite this lack of time and skill, I didn’t want our designs to languish in obscurity, so I drafted\\r\\nsome mock-ups and wrote a lengthy blog entry explaining how they worked. I informed the\\r\\nLugRadio community and expected silence: the world moving on, our designs unnoticed. A few weeks later I wandered onto the LugRadio forums and noticed that some code had been\\r\\ncommitted to a repository. I downloaded it and it looked like an incredibly simple first cut of\\r\\nthe interface that existed in my mock-ups. I was stunned. So was Aq.

New\\r\\npeople joined the team, including Laszlo Pandy, who became the subsequent leader of the\\r\\nproject. A little later in the development, the project got an important name change; I wasn’t keen on\\r\\nJonoEdit. After asking for suggestions, Steve Parkes, one of the original LugRadio presenters,\\r\\nsuggested Jokosher. The name was formed from “Jo” and “Kosher,” which he claimed as “No\\r\\nBacon,” thus constructing my name. Again, I was flattered. It felt weird, but the team liked the\\r\\nnew name, so we stuck with it. Everyone worked hard. We spent long evenings writing code, debugging, fixing bugs, and\\r\\nwriting documentation. Piece by piece we built not only an application but also a community. We developed a sense of unity, and we started to become a team. Eventually, after months of work, we made a first release. From a few ideas, expressed with\\r\\nmy amateur-grade design skills, we built something that people could touch. Today, although\\r\\nI have stepped back to work on other things, Jokosher is a thriving project. Most Free Software projects form from one person scratching an itch.

The application was rooted in a\\r\\nnew approach to interaction design, so having a documented design was essential. The design\\r\\nand accompanying specification of the interface acted as a reference from which to build the\\r\\nsoftware. What this experience taught me, entirely by chance, was that the speed and success of a\\r\\ncommunity has a direct correlation to strategy, structure, and planning: even a simple set of\\r\\nmock-ups can help drive progress in the right direction.

First I present a high-level discussion of the top priorities and get the basics down. Next I focus on the details and flesh out the subject. This approach makes introducing the\\r\\nsubject more akin to lowering yourself into a warm pool on a sunny day, as opposed to hurling\\r\\nyourself into an icy river in Finland. Our goal in this chapter is to explore how to build a strategy for our communities. We first\\r\\nexplore four foundations within community. Each of these houses the underlying details that\\r\\nwe explore throughout the rest of the book. Inside these foundations are teams, the vessels of\\r\\ncommunity, which we later crack open to see how they work. Next we define our mission,\\r\\nobjectives, and goals and build them into a final strategic plan. We are going to cover a lot of\\r\\nground in this chapter, so grab a cup of tea (I would also recommend a Hobnob to dip in it)\\r\\nand get comfortable. With many areas of discussion, we need to pick out the key concepts and have them close at\\r\\nhand. It is easy to forget or skim over some subtle yet important aspects in community growth. To make this simple, we will add them to a TODO list as we uncover them throughout the\\r\\nchapter. Community TODO List\\r\\n• Example item. • Example item.

If we think of a community as an interspersed group of dots huddled together over a shared\\r\\ninterest (e.g., protesting a ludicrous law, discussing a topic, building an operating system),\\r\\nteams are the smaller subgroups typically based around a primary interest or skill set (e.g.,\\r\\nadvocacy and documentation) that helps forward that shared interest.

These are\\r\\nthe teams that we seek to build: to break our wider community into smaller, more manageable\\r\\nchunks. Each team is united by solving a part of the grander aim of the community.

As I mentioned earlier, although your teams have a primary focus (such as translations), there\\r\\nwill be many other skills present in your teams, and many people will be in multiple teams.

He wanted normality. He wanted a house, a\\r\\ngirlfriend, and a regular life, not life in a small bus with four hygienically challenged musos. Adam still wanted a passion, though (without the star). He needed an interest to wrap his\\r\\nnatural sense of curiosity and exploration around. So he bought a computer. Even though it was the year 2000 and he was 24, it may surprise you that Adam had never\\r\\nowned a computer before. Immediately puzzled with his new friend, he bought a magazine to\\r\\nunderstand it better, and said magazine happened to feature the Linux operating system on\\r\\nthe cover. Not knowing any better, he jumped in and installed it. Of course, it was an epic\\r\\ndisaster, as Linux generally was back then. While trying to find help, Adam stumbled across\\r\\nhis first community, which doubled as a team: my Linux user group. When Adam walked in, he faced the same fears, uncertainties, and curiosities that I shared at\\r\\nthe start of the book. However, he was equally as inspired and intrigued by the concept of\\r\\ncommunity. Although he felt weird, he also felt compelled to stick with it. When Adam first joined the group, he asked a barrage of questions, regularly apologizing when\\r\\nhe felt they were “stupid,” despite reassurances that there were no stupid questions. As he built his confidence, he started experimenting. The group had become an excellent place\\r\\nfor people to give away old equipment. Adam would take this endless stream of clapped-out\\r\\ngadgets, try new software, and share his experiences with the rest of the group. As new\\r\\nmembers joined and asked questions, he would answer them and share his experiences. He\\r\\nwas fast becoming something of a Linux expert. He continued to play, continued to grow, studied at university, and, before long, landed a job\\r\\nas a system administrator. Shortly after that he met his girlfriend, Jenny, and soon they moved\\r\\ninto their own house, Adam had achieved what he wanted: normality, a sense of security, and\\r\\na passion.

This “Circle of Life”\\r\\nphilosophy provides the team with a consistent exchange of experiences and value. If we slice open a team, we can see a number of generations, like rings in a tree trunk. Each\\r\\ngeneration is a source of stories (already established in the previous chapter as an important\\r\\nsource of communication) and also a source of mentorship. Each generation passes down\\r\\nstories, experiences, and life lessons to the new generation. This is exactly what happened with Adam. When he joined the group, he needed assistance\\r\\nand support. When he received this help, the team provided a sense of value to him. This value\\r\\ninspired Adam to treat the team with respect and to prioritize its importance in his life. As the\\r\\nteam opened doors to knowledge, social connections opened and he felt a sense of belonging. This belonging was sealed each time he imparted his own experience to new and existing\\r\\nmembers of the group; he would duly receive the appreciation and thanks that he delivered\\r\\nto others when he was new. Part of the reason why Adam had such a positive experience is that he understood the full\\r\\nbreadth of the team.

A typical example of scope that is\\r\\nfamiliar to all of us is the place in which we live. The world is a pretty big place. Its magnitude is reinforced by the television, websites, books,\\r\\nstories, and photographs that we see every day. For thousands of years, humans and animals\\r\\nhave developed a natural inclination to divide the world into more manageable chunks.

We can define Trekkies as fans—they enjoy a common interest together, either online or at\\r\\nconventions around the world, and their primary role is to share the consumption of that\\r\\ninterest with others. As fans, Trekkies rarely have any direct impact on the unifying interest:\\r\\nthe average Trekkie could not change the storyline of the show, contribute to the costumes or\\r\\nthe digital effects, or improve what already exists. Instead, collaboration in the Trekkie world\\r\\nproduces content for other Trekkies: it won’t take you long to find wonderfully detailed fan-\\r\\nmade costumes, props, tattoos, fan fiction, and other creations. Although there appears to be a very distinctive collaborative divide between the provider (the\\r\\nshow) and the consumer (the fan), there is a middle ground. These communities are becoming\\r\\nincreasingly important to providers and never before have artists, musicians, producers, and\\r\\npoliticians been so aware of their followers. The Internet has enabled fans to connect more\\r\\neasily with their heroes, and this has developed a kind of collaboration. There are many examples of this. Stephen Fry, a well-respected British actor, started using the\\r\\nTwitter microblogging service and within months he had 400,000 people following his updates. The Obama administration has made use of blogging and YouTube extensively to distribute\\r\\ncontent and invite feedback. One producer who has engaged repeatedly with his fan community is Joss Whedon, the\\r\\nAcademy Award-nominated and Hugo Award-winning American writer, director, and\\r\\nexecutive producer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Whedon has been known to use a range of online\\r\\nmediums to interact with fans, and has even referenced fan contributions in his work. One such example was a reference in an episode to a “Polgara demon. ” The name “Polgara”\\r\\noriginally comes from books written by American author David Eddings.

Those who think that\\r\\ndriving a car with a blue neon light underneath it will impress us are going to be sadly\\r\\ndisappointed. Few would argue that a meritocracy is a bad thing.

His seemingly generous increase took a daily wage\\r\\nfrom $2.34 to $5. Back in 1914, this was unheard of, and rocked other industrialists and Wall\\r\\nStreet. Ford’s reasoning was simple and elegant, though: he wanted his employees to be able\\r\\nto afford the very cars they were building. Ford knew that if his employees could afford to buy Ford cars, they would value their\\r\\ncontributions to the company more. His employees would be able to see, feel, and enjoy the\\r\\nfruits of their labor. Your teams also need to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Volunteer communities can sometimes\\r\\nfeel like production lines. The work is not always enjoyable and not always pleasant. There are\\r\\ntimes in every community when repetition, housekeeping, and conflict play a role in an\\r\\notherwise enjoyable merry-go-round. When the community begins to see more bureaucracy\\r\\nand repetition than useful and enjoyable contributions, something is wrong. Very wrong. It is\\r\\nimportant, in these challenging times, to remind your community members of their crusade\\r\\nand the value of their work in achieving it. Ford’s generous wages did not come without a catch. The increased salary that his workers\\r\\nenjoyed was only available to employees who had been at the company for six months or more,\\r\\nand also demanded that employees lived their lives in a way that the company’s “Social\\r\\nDepartment” approved of: no excessive drinking or gambling.

Often these deeper, hidden kinds of diversity teach us life’s most valuable lessons. While all\\r\\nequality is important, we need to grow this sense of deep-level diversity. At the start of the chapter we identified that we need to build an environment that is conducive\\r\\nto energizing and enabling our community. Deep-level diversity is the open door that\\r\\nwelcomes this enablement. When you encourage this deep-level diversity of contributions\\r\\n(e.g., translations, documentation, development) as well as diversity of opinions, values, and\\r\\nexperience, your members will feel unrestrained, unrestricted, and energized. This should be\\r\\na constant consideration throughout your work. Unfortunately, many communities merely focus on hammering home equality of surface-level\\r\\ndiversity, but Graen suggests in Dealing with Diversity that it doesn’t make a big difference in\\r\\nthe effectiveness of the community:\\r\\nIn a study of 45 teams from electronics divisions of three major corporations, Pelled, Eisenhardt,\\r\\nand Xin (1999) found that the effects of surface-level diversity (age) on emotional conflict\\r\\ndiminished as a function of team longevity. Similarly, Chatman and Flynn (2001) found that\\r\\ndemographic homogeneity (race and gender) was less predictive of team cooperation as team\\r\\nmembers interacted with each other. This insight is interesting when combined with another research study, also discussed in\\r\\nGraen's book, that found that deep-level diversity provides the kinds of benefits we are\\r\\nlooking for:\\r\\nIn a study of 144 student project teams, Harrison, Price, Gavin, and Florey (2002) found that\\r\\nsurface-level diversity negatively affected early cohesion in the team. Over the course of a\\r\\nsemester working together, surface-level diversity became less predictive, whereas actual deep-\\r\\nlevel diversity (measured by conscientiousness, task meaningfulness, and outcome importance)\\r\\nand perceptions of deep-level diversity became increasingly important to team social cohesion\\r\\nand performance. Although this experiment may seem a little abstract, Graen summarizes that “as team members\\r\\ninteract, attributions about underlying differences based on race, gender, and age are likely to\\r\\nbe minimized; however, the underlying differences in terms of personality, values, and\\r\\nattitudes are likely to have an increasingly negative effect on team cohesion and performance.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0963268b-653c-4fc1-95be-646c69d6e980":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0963268b-653c-4fc1-95be-646c69d6e980\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4eOlm4ZPSA7y3clPXAphyYgbA64S7uWRTMhcvRToXbM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"7I6MRwec/Pl1JWnp6JYsb/fwHjFnVczk7Vlq2sf+ZGc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"21d00a64-5a03-4bb6-849e-367e386fcc65\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"OZfd+0zOYVmMGPVrl7awE8KI14ZEYWUxYOaHVq1NCTc=\"}},\"hash\":\"Th0Ck4ykYUzbvZmrrwkb7N0teALxvM7qmnsyJvDg2hs=\",\"text\":\"”\\r\\nWe need to be cognizant of these underlying deep-level attributes in people and ensure that\\r\\nwe encourage and help them thrive in our communities.

An example of this problem occurred in a derivative distribution of Ubuntu called Xubuntu.

Some\\r\\ntime ago, the community unfortunately hit something of a roadblock when deciding in which\\r\\ndirection to move forward.

To resolve this, I stepped in and scheduled a public online meeting and invited the entire\\r\\nXubuntu community to attend. My first goal was to focus on what the community agreed\\r\\non.

The integration in Xubuntu is at a configuration level, a toolkit level, and matching the\\r\\nunderlying technology beneath the desktop in Ubuntu. Xubuntu will be built and developed as\\r\\npart of the wider Ubuntu community, based around the ideals and values of Ubuntu. I managed to converge on this statement by repeatedly refining it based on feedback. This\\r\\nhappened over and over again until we got something that virtually everyone agreed on.

Cody worked with\\r\\nthe community using the approach I recommended and produced a full strategic plan. The\\r\\nXubuntu community went on to do some great work built around this strategy. Building a Mission Statement\\r\\nIn the same way the Xubuntu community agreed on their high-level goals, a mission statement\\r\\nholds a lot of value for any kind of collaborative project, be it a commercial product or a\\r\\nvolunteer community. These statements emphasize the promise, opportunity, and definition\\r\\nof what your community is seeking to achieve. Their purpose is to articulate ambition with a\\r\\ndetailed, succinct, and elegant approach. Mission statements help get everyone in your\\r\\ncommunity on the same page. Mission statements are intended to be consistent and should rarely change, even if the tasks\\r\\nthat achieve that mission change regularly. When building your mission statement, always\\r\\nhave its longevity in mind. Remember, your mission statement is your slam-dunking,\\r\\naudacious goal. For many communities these missions can take decades or even longer to\\r\\nachieve. Their purpose is to not only describe the finish line, but also help the community stay\\r\\non track. Many of us are more than familiar with mission statements. They are one of the first documents\\r\\nwe see when we join a new company. Unfortunately, staff members typically ignore them. These statements are usually written by senior management and often bear no day-to-day\\r\\nresemblance to the work done by the folks on the ground. Don’t use these often-pointless\\r\\nexamples as a reason to consider mission statements irrelevant: these companies are simply\\r\\ndoing it wrong. The mission needs to be at the forefront of every member’s mind, and should\\r\\nbe a regular driving force that is the justification behind the day-to-day work.

Nonsoftware communities often use other kinds of metrics,\\r\\nsuch as an amount of money to raise in donations or a date when a particular event or initiative\\r\\nis launched. FIXED SOFTWARE CYCLES\\r\\nMany of you reading the The Art of Community will be seeking to apply these principles to open\\r\\nsource software development. With this in mind, here are a few more words on the merits of fixed\\r\\nrelease cycles versus the release-when-ready approach. Fixed release cycles offer many benefits to your users and developers:\\r\\n• They’re predictable and reliable. Your users know when every release will happen. • It’s easier to break the cycle into parts. When the cycle is fixed in length each time, you can\\r\\ndivide it into the requisite parts (development, translations, UI freeze, hard freeze, release\\r\\ncandidate, etc. ) more easily. • Particularly for open source projects, fixed release cycles make it easier for distributions to\\r\\nfactor your release into their road map. This happens with the GNOME and Ubuntu projects,\\r\\nfor example. There is, however, one distinctive disadvantage with a fixed cycle: it makes it harder to develop\\r\\nlarge new features and changes that take longer than the duration of the cycle to implement. This is\\r\\nsomething we discovered in the Ubuntu community. Planning longer-term features sometimes needs\\r\\nto be broken into chunks and spread across release cycles. Interestingly, breaking the problem into\\r\\nchunks is often a better approach, regardless of release cycles. Release cycles are fairly serious beasts. Fortunately, they lead to more fun and exciting prospects:\\r\\nour goals. When you hit these goals, you should let your hair down and celebrate, and when this\\r\\noccurs regularly, it reaffirms a strong sense of community and teamwork by acknowledging that you\\r\\nhave all been working your socks off toward your goals.

We will\\r\\nfamiliarize ourselves with this structure and then begin discussing how we can identify the\\r\\nobjectives and goals to fill it. Before we begin, you should remember to fulfill your role as a\\r\\nfacilitator and work with your community in a transparent fashion to combine input, feedback,\\r\\nand opinion into a single consistent plan that everyone can follow. There are many, many ways of structuring a strategic plan. Everyone has his own approach,\\r\\nand countless books have been written on the subject. The technique that I am going to use\\r\\nhere is one that I have found particularly effective for the communities that I have been\\r\\ninvolved in. Unfortunately, many of the books written about strategic design and planning are\\r\\nwritten with businesses in mind, and some aspects of business strategic planning are unsuitable\\r\\nfor community strategy. This is because business strategic planning typically presumes an organizational structure that\\r\\nprovides a more central decision-making function: it is always clear who has the authority and\\r\\nexpectation to make decisions. Ironically, this perspective is becoming increasingly old-school\\r\\nin business circles, with many businesses focusing on a more community-oriented\\r\\ncollaborative planning approach that helps foster deeper team commitment even when there’s\\r\\na central position of responsibility (not authority). The challenge here is that there is no cut-and-dried path to community, and the same applies\\r\\nto your strategic planning. As you grow and build your community, you should feel free to\\r\\nexperiment, explore, and refine the approach we use here. You should develop a strategic plan\\r\\nthat works for you and your specific community. Our approach here involves defining a number of objectives. These are the broad, high-level\\r\\nthings that you want to achieve. Each objective is divided into a number of goals. Each goal\\r\\nincludes three pieces of information. •   The success criteria describe a set of measurable methods for evaluating the goal’s success. You should be able to look at this statement and determine straightaway whether the goal\\r\\nwas achieved (example: 20 new community members). •   The implementation plan describes what tasks need to happen to achieve the goal.

Let’s look at an example of an objective and one of its goals (remember\\r\\nthat most objectives will have many goals):\\r\\nOBJECTIVE: Build a website for the project. GOAL: Build a structural design for the website content. SUCCESS CRITERIA:\\r\\nAll areas of the website structure documented in a specification. Community feedback gathered on the proposal.

Email the core community team with feedback and merge feedback in. Organize an online meeting to propose any changes to the specification. Build a prototype. OWNER: Jono Bacon. This example demonstrates a number of subtle points in building a comprehensive strategic\\r\\nplan:\\r\\n•The OBJECTIVE should be a specific outcome that you would like to achieve. These should\\r\\nbe high-level (such as “Build a website for the project”) but not too fluffy (such as “Make\\r\\neveryone feel warm and fuzzy”). •   Each objective can have a number of GOALS, and each goal should have SUCCESS\\r\\nCRITERIA, IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, and (where appropriate) OWNER items. •The SUCCESS CRITERIA should be a set of measurable assessment methods. You should\\r\\nbe able to look at each SUCCESS CRITERIA point and definitively know whether it was\\r\\nachieved. Each item should clearly state what needs to be achieved to be considered\\r\\ncomplete. Avoid vague and general statements; instead, use specifics. Success criteria help\\r\\nthe wider community reach a consensus on what constitutes success and identify when\\r\\nprogress is being made. •The IMPLEMENTATION PLAN is a set of reasonably granular steps that indicate how you\\r\\ncan achieve the goal. •   In some cases it makes sense to assign an OWNER to a goal, even if that owner merely\\r\\nhas oversight in getting it done. OWNER does not necessarily map to responsibility for the\\r\\ngoal in a community, although it typically does in the business world. With this consistent structure across your plan, you will be able to effectively document the\\r\\nbroad objectives and specific goals and measure and evaluate progress on your action points.

Technique 2: Think outside the box\\r\\nWhile we are all wrapped up in self-reflective thought, you should also question what you\\r\\ncould achieve if you let your imagination run loose. What are the subconscious limitations that\\r\\nyou are placing on yourself when thinking of ideas? In other words, if all the barriers are\\r\\nremoved, what is possible? A great example of this is the Nintendo Wii game console. For years, console after console had\\r\\nshipped with a control pad that players used to control the on-screen characters. These pads\\r\\nwent through many variations, but they all shared one common characteristic: the buttons\\r\\ncontrolled the action. Of course, there were attempts at alternatives: light guns, dance mats, plastic guitars and drums. Most still had the assumed knowledge that the player controlled the action by pressing buttons. These alternative approaches were never a core part of the systems. They were novelty add-\\r\\nons that often had limited appeal. The Wii changed all of that. Shigeru Miyamoto, a renowned video game designer and cocreator\\r\\nof many games, including Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, and The Legend of Zelda, sat\\r\\ndown with other designers and questioned whether they should be limited to the existing\\r\\nnorms of the game interface. The result was one of the most significant developments in video game history: the Wii Remote,\\r\\nwhich allowed gamers to control the action by moving the unit itself. This enabled all manner\\r\\nof physical interactions, from 10-pin bowling to boxing to ski-jumping. The Wii changed how\\r\\nwe think about video games, and is clearly having an effect on the design of other consumer\\r\\nproducts as well. Thinking outside the box takes time and focus to master. The trick is in questioning everything\\r\\naround you. A great exercise for this is to spend an hour noticing the details in your world and\\r\\nquestioning why they work the way they do.

Traditionally, you would\\r\\nbrainstorm the attributes of a great cell phone. Instead, turn everything on its head. What\\r\\nwould make the worst possible cell phone? Maybe it ignores all calls? Or maybe it only accepts\\r\\ncalls from telemarketing companies? Maybe the buttons are too small? How about really short\\r\\nbattery life? When you ask these kinds of questions in a brainstorming session, it almost always breaks the\\r\\nice and gets people talking. Such ridiculous questions generate a lot of fun discussion, laughter,\\r\\nand ludicrous ideas. Make sure you write down every one of these nuggets of madness. After your group has exhausted their initial pool of ideas, you should invert each idea again. How do we make sure that our phone accepts all calls? How can it avoid calls from\\r\\ntelemarketing companies? How can we make sure the buttons are the right size and not too\\r\\nsmall? How can we improve battery life? Aside from the benefits of getting your group brainstorming, this approach is an excellent\\r\\nmethod in building defenses against the infuriation of normal life. It helps to identify frustrating\\r\\nattributes and protect against them, and this will in turn provide better results.

We explored how\\r\\nmeritocracy, diversity, and working together can help us build these units of belonging. Since that discussion, we have identified a set of objectives, each with related goals. It is now\\r\\ntime to divide our community into a set of healthy, motivated teams. Although we are going to strategically develop a set of teams to form our community, you\\r\\nshould encourage free-form team creation. Giving your community the ability to build its own\\r\\nteams without prior approval can produce incredibly diverse and productive results. We have\\r\\nseen this in droves in the Ubuntu community, with many seemingly random teams doing great\\r\\nwork in areas we never envisaged. Although the door should be open to form new teams, a primary set of teams will perform\\r\\nmuch of the work in the community.

Your objectives and the work necessary to\\r\\nachieve them should be no surprise to your primary community members who were involved\\r\\nin constructing this strategy. To achieve our strategic goals, we need to form these teams that\\r\\nare so important to our community. There are many approaches to setting up teams, and there is no standard recipe for how to do\\r\\nthis. It varies among different types of community, and it varies among the experience and\\r\\nexpectations of your existing members. When deciding on teams, consult again with your\\r\\nexisting community. Have a discussion about which teams make sense. You can’t build teams\\r\\nout of nothing, and as such, your first set of teams will almost certainly map to regularly\\r\\ncontributing community members who want to engage in certain types of work. As an\\r\\nexample, if you have contributors who want to work on documentation, they would be a great\\r\\nfoundation for a documentation team. When most communities set up teams, the approach is almost always based on what similar\\r\\ncommunities have done. As an example, most open source projects will have development,\\r\\ndocumentation, and translation teams. This is largely because these teams are what we are\\r\\nfamiliar with in those communities. I highly recommend that you look into these existing\\r\\ncommunities and learn from their approach. This can offer valuable insight about the most\\r\\nsuitable solution for you. For most communities, it seems that teams typically map very well to primary skills. Earlier\\r\\non when we built our initial notes about our community, we created our own list of these\\r\\nSKILLS REQUIRED. Many of these skills often map well to teams. As an example, a software project will typically require these skills:\\r\\n•   Programming\\r\\n•   Writing documentation\\r\\n•   Testing\\r\\n•   Bug triage\\r\\n•   Advocacy\\r\\n•   Website development\\r\\nEach of these skills could map to the following teams:\\r\\n•   Programming→Development Team\\r\\n•   Writing documentation→Documentation Team\\r\\n•   Testing→QA Team\\r\\n•   Bug triage→QA Team\\r\\n•   Advocacy→Marketing Team\\r\\n•   Website development→Web Team\\r\\nPLANNING YOUR COMMUNITY   59\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"dcadeff5-63e9-47df-84b6-704e55b66b92":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"dcadeff5-63e9-47df-84b6-704e55b66b92\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"dxMdiqlM6Ss9iJXyGlocR6pYunwAn8FiJAv47t1Codw=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"91nJORvIO9oYm4+A8GIUMSI80/4lRiUX53kkGgCkhvk=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c021e9b9-0b74-42a5-999f-7b0163566f6f\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"FBjmkIz3GvX7PoMt3W++Uo1s/w4uMXrUxeuMNaiaomA=\"}},\"hash\":\"SdLww2up+PSnpe+nJd0QPR7ccUtTa9g5mSeygZc1m/M=\",\"text\":\"Some skills (such as testing and bug triage) naturally map to the same teams.

Although you want to ensure that a good range of teams\\r\\ncover the different types of contributions, you don’t want to overload your community. Form\\r\\nnew teams only when existing teams cannot sufficiently cater to new needs and requirements. It is important that your teams have the ability to expand their mandate, adjusting their focus\\r\\nas they mature. As an example, a documentation team may expand to include general\\r\\ncommunications and education. As such, try to foresee this growth while keeping the team\\r\\nfocused. Define the scope of each team, and help team members understand that scope\\r\\nEarlier we created a mission statement for the wider community, but mission statements can\\r\\nbe useful for specific teams, too. For each team you should produce a mission statement that outlines the specific work that the\\r\\nteam performs. With this statement available for each team, you will better understand how\\r\\nyour teams fit together, and so will prospective contributors: this statement will help you\\r\\narticulate the purpose of the team and help new contributors know which team to join. As before, your definition should explain the typical activities that the team will do. As an\\r\\nexample, the following could be used to describe a documentation team:\\r\\nThe documentation team identifies and prioritizes areas in which documentation is required,\\r\\nbuilds processes for producing high-quality documentation and best practice, and produces said\\r\\ndocumentation. As a continued effort in transparency and openness, when writing team mission statements I\\r\\nrecommend that you work together with other members of your community who are on those\\r\\nteams, in order to come to an agreement on them. Understand the extent and range of collaboration among our teams\\r\\nTeams are not insulated from one another. Every team needs to work with other teams, and\\r\\nsome will have more crossover than others. Identify how your teams will interact in different\\r\\nways, and try to optimize for those teams that cross over the most. Identifying these collaborative crossovers typically requires a significant amount of day-to-day\\r\\nexperience in how the community functions. With this in mind, you should regularly observe\\r\\nhow your community’s teams collaborate.

The answer to these questions is complex and multifaceted. My recommended approach is to\\r\\nidentify how you communicate tasks, issues, and goodwill:\\r\\nTasks\\r\\nEnable teams to share and report what they are working on. When teams are able to\\r\\nidentify who is working on what, this avoids duplication and confusion. Great approaches\\r\\nto this are regular meetings, notes, and articles (such as blog entries). This will be discussed\\r\\nin more detail later in this book, when we refine our communication facilities and\\r\\nprocesses. Issues\\r\\nHave regular, open opportunities for teams to communicate. Every team will have\\r\\nquestions, concerns, queries, opportunities, and other topics to communicate to other\\r\\nteams. We need to ensure that these lines of communication are open. Again, regular,\\r\\npublished meetings are the perfect opportunity to cover these kinds of issues. Goodwill\\r\\nEncourage and inspire strong and positive relations between teams. Always remember\\r\\nthat your teams are part of the same mission. As such, they should celebrate victories\\r\\ntogether and console one another in hard times. If you don’t focus enough on ensuring\\r\\nthat teams feel part of the same machine working together in the right direction, the\\r\\ncommunity will feel fragmented. This all boils down to bonding. Different teams should\\r\\nregularly bond together, either online, at physical meetings, and/or during other\\r\\noccasions. We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 12, when we discuss events. In\\r\\nthe Ubuntu community, this occurs at every Ubuntu Developer Summit: different teams\\r\\nbond together, which helps the project as a whole. As mentioned, we can achieve each of these methods of communication by producing a set of\\r\\nprocesses and events that every team makes use of. Reporting can help with tasks, regular\\r\\nmeetings can help with issues, and social interaction and bonding can help with goodwill. We\\r\\nwill talk later in this book about these different elements and how to implement them. Setting expectations is critical in building community.

Equipment\\r\\nWhat equipment is required for participation that would be unreasonable to expect a\\r\\ncommunity member to possess? As an example, for a software community we can\\r\\nreasonably expect our community members to have a computer and Internet access (we\\r\\nshould not pay for these from the community organization’s pockets). Continuing the\\r\\nexample, custom hardware may have to be loaned to a community member for him to do\\r\\nhis work. For local communities other equipment, such as tools and materials for a DIY\\r\\ngroup or facilities for a music group, may be required. Travel\\r\\nOne of the most common costs in communities is travel; this can be difficult to do on a\\r\\nshoestring, but it is possible. Before you decide you need a travel budget, you should assess\\r\\nwhether you can be represented at the event by asking friends for help (e.g., asking\\r\\ncommunity members local to the event to attend). Events\\r\\nOf course, you may want to put on your own events and feel you need funds to either\\r\\nrun the event and/or fund travel and accommodation for some of your community\\r\\nmembers.

Volunteer communities are driven by members with a set\\r\\nof values that reflect themselves and the values of the wider community. These values are\\r\\nimportant to regularly reinforce in your community: they are the metabolism that fights off\\r\\nthe threats and problems that can undermine the goals of the community. When your\\r\\nmembers feel like they are disconnected from the community, they lose their sense of value. Communication can be divided into three primary areas:\\r\\nIncoming\\r\\nReceiving and processing feedback and viewpoints for the purpose of improvement. An\\r\\nexample of this could include surveys to determine how well a part of your community\\r\\nis working. Outgoing\\r\\nSharing news, stories, and achievements from the community with the rest of the world. An example of this could be showing off something your community has created. Internal\\r\\nInternal discussions and meetings in the community to discuss objectives, goals, conflict,\\r\\nand other issues. An example of this could include meetings that are designed to decide\\r\\nhow your community will work together toward its goals. Each of these forms of communication is essential for a strong community. All communities\\r\\nneed open and objective feedback. They should all share their achievements and what they\\r\\nCOMMUNICATING CLEARLY   73\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f2cefe99-7b36-4a10-93bf-bd6bcef88daa":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f2cefe99-7b36-4a10-93bf-bd6bcef88daa\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cXvQk9Kt6tE0hpwJ1aMXiiE4+g8hDA/RlLpCesMpCGg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"WXWIVCaU14dMp112LPjjHkhoOJDyr2L+u6zqW7bFIIo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b9d47336-e2bf-4a82-bf50-019f41dcb7bc\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ad0hGtOiKpxPSdVzbwIXcIgdbl0X2QXMxSLW3m8WhNI=\"}},\"hash\":\"J8xa8mifvBUoOVk2iMg2FmJ04U3EPoJJAo4PcpeR0WA=\",\"text\":\"have produced. Finally, all communities need to have regular internal discussions and meetings\\r\\nto ensure that everyone is interacting smoothly. Great communication should be a goal for the\\r\\nmany different parts of your community, as opposed to one specific area. When we get great\\r\\ncommunication right, community feels vibrant, thriving, and accessible. We are going to cover all three of these topics in this book. We will discuss incoming\\r\\ncommunication in Chapter 8, outgoing communication in Chapter 7, and internal\\r\\ncommunication here. Striving for Clarity\\r\\nAs communication is critical to the success of your community, it is stunning how many\\r\\ncommunities just get it plain wrong. Many are plagued with long-winded, overly complex, and\\r\\ndifficult-to-use communication channels, and it seems you need a degree in rocket science to\\r\\nunderstand how to join these channels. Then, it seems you need to go back to school to get a\\r\\ndegree in computational linguistics to fit into the culture and expectations of these\\r\\ncommunication channels. Many have an unwritten rule book stapled to the side of the\\r\\nchannel, and if you are unfamiliar with its scriptures, the response can be terse, forthright, and\\r\\nsometimes outright rude. This is the last thing you want. Instead, you want to create simple,\\r\\nefficient, welcoming, and enjoyable methods of keeping in touch with other members of the\\r\\nproject. The greatest form of communication is always going to be sitting in a room with a real person,\\r\\nface to face. In this setting you can speak freely, your words flowing as quickly as your brain\\r\\nconjures them up, with body language, gestures, and facial expressions further augmenting\\r\\nthe flow of conversation. Any technological form of communication is going to compromise\\r\\nsome of these attributes. Of course, many who are socially uncomfortable in face-to-face\\r\\nsituations will hail the muting of these additional attributes in conversation as a victory for\\r\\naccessibility and openness. When laying down the lines of communication for our community, our goal is to strive for\\r\\nclarity. Imagine, if you will, a world in which every communication is clear, accessible, and well\\r\\nunderstood by your community. You need to think carefully about the culture in which your\\r\\ncommunity communicates and strive to build a highway and driving style that achieves that\\r\\nculture.

If the communications are complex, socially fraught, or otherwise\\r\\nsuboptimal, potential members may prefer to spend their valuable spare time playing Guitar\\r\\nHero rather than joining you and your band of merry men and women. Achieving clarity requires attention to two areas. First, a sensible choice of communication\\r\\nmedium is required (mailing list, IRC, forum, etc.). This is relatively straightforward and\\r\\nactually fairly uninteresting. We will make some decisions about this over the following pages. The second, more complex part is picking communication channels that match the needs of\\r\\nthe users while maximizing clarity. Let’s spend some time talking about that. Choices, Choices\\r\\nYour community has oodles of communication channels to choose from, each with qualities\\r\\nthat make sense in different scenarios and to different people. The goal is to match the right\\r\\nmedium to your community and to understand the pros and cons of that medium to help the\\r\\npros bubble to the surface and keep the cons well away from the kitchen. Picking an appropriate medium is largely about understanding your contributors and their\\r\\nworkflow. Each type of contributor will have different preferences. Software developers\\r\\ngenerally prefer content to be delivered directly to them. They are typically most comfortable\\r\\nwith mailing lists and RSS feeds (updated content from websites and online resources) and\\r\\ndon’t like to have to refresh a browser to see if new content exists. This is part of why many\\r\\n(typically Western) developers don’t get on very well with forums. Some communities have\\r\\nbridged this divide by providing gateways so that a mailing list post goes to a forum and vice\\r\\nversa (an example of this is the Banshee project at http://banshee-project.org/support/). NOTE\\r\\nOf course, many developers do love forums. The last statement was based on\\r\\ngeneral experience with developers over a range of projects and development\\r\\ncultures, largely in Western countries. If you know developers who love forums,\\r\\ndon’t be alarmed: we are all friends here. Users are (typically) different. Users often love forums for their accessibility and simplicity. The\\r\\nconversation flow is clear, the interface is friendly, and the web browser is a familiar window\\r\\nto that world.

You can then make informed choices. We will explore some of these common\\r\\nmediums and some notes that can help inform these choices in just a moment. Communication fetishism\\r\\nAnother key consideration when building effective communication channels is keeping\\r\\ndiscussion focused. This is a two-part process in avoiding communication fetishism and also keeping\\r\\nall your eyeballs in one place. Communication fetishism is particularly prevalent in online and technical communities and\\r\\npoints to the problem of new communities wanting to provide every possible communication\\r\\nchannel under the sun. They set up mailing lists, forums, IRC channels, Second Life worlds,\\r\\nand more. This is the wrong thing to do. You should instead identify the key roles and\\r\\npersonalities in your project and choose mediums that make the most sense to those roles. Let’s look at an example. When I set up the Jokosher project, I knew that the primary roles in the community were\\r\\ngoing to be users and developers. I wanted to ensure that the project had communication\\r\\nchannels for technical discussion about the development of the application, but also a place\\r\\nfor musicians to discuss Jokosher, share tips, and show off their compositions. I decided to set\\r\\nup a mailing list for the developers and a forum for the users. These mediums reflected the\\r\\nrespective developer and user roles well. The only other medium I set up was a #jokosher IRC\\r\\nchannel for real-time discussion and meetings for the developers. Although the channel exists,\\r\\nwe never point regular users to that channel; the forum is far more appropriate. The second part of the process is “keeping all your eyeballs in one place. ” One of the mistakes\\r\\na lot of new communities make is to fragment individual communication mediums too heavily. Let’s look at another example. When we started LugRadio, I wanted us to provide a place for listeners to talk about the show\\r\\nand the topics in each episode.

What\\r\\nis worse, some get confused and just don’t post at all. Discussion gets going faster when you\\r\\nhave fewer choices. The Mediums\\r\\nWith some general best practices under our belts, let’s now roll up our sleeves and take a look\\r\\nat the nitty-gritty of the range of mediums available to us. Over the following few pages I am\\r\\ngoing to provide a quick-shot summary of these mediums and many of their behavioral\\r\\nelements. Before we begin, we need to discuss a key consideration in choosing an effective medium: how\\r\\neasy it is to record and retrieve conversations that have occurred in the past. When\\r\\ncommunicating with others online, each medium places different opportunities in the hands\\r\\nof others to find these conversations. This attribute can dramatically adjust how people behave\\r\\nand converse in a given medium. As an example, it is well known in many communities that mailing lists have their\\r\\nconversations archived and publicly available on a website. This website is then archived and\\r\\nretrievable by search engines, such as Google. With this in mind, participants in mailing lists\\r\\noften act in a more formalized and “professional” capacity: you never know when that\\r\\nconversation on a mailing list will show up when a prospective employer is Googling you for\\r\\na job interview. On the flip side, there is the real-time IRC chat medium. While many IRC channels can and\\r\\nare logged, it is far harder to find the logs and find relevant discussion in the reams of chatter\\r\\nthat happen each day on an IRC channel. As such, the medium feels less recorded, and many\\r\\nof the participants feel more comfortable in communicating more socially. You should consider these implications when building out your communication facilities, and\\r\\nensure that your participants are fully aware of where they stand. No one wants a situation\\r\\nwhere someone says something, assuming it is not archived, and then finds (to his chagrin)\\r\\nthat it appears in a Google search.

Mailing lists are typically preferred by software developers, and of common interest in the open\\r\\nsource world. Many nonprogramming contributors often use and enjoy mailing lists. Mailing lists are not all sweetness and light, though. Joining a mailing list is a little complex. It requires people to know how to join, sign up with an email address, respond to the mail,\\r\\nand know where to send messages. Also, unforgiving spam filters can make the whole process\\r\\nicky. Mailing lists also assume that you are interested in all discussions, and when you join, all\\r\\ndiscussions come to you. This makes mailing lists implicitly of most interest to those who plan\\r\\na serious contribution or interest in a community. Another issue to bear in mind with mailing lists is their lack of immediacy. As an example, if\\r\\nyou are a community software developer working at 10 p.m. on a Saturday and you have a\\r\\nproblem, you could post a question to the mailing list, but you may not get an answer until\\r\\nMonday or Tuesday and are thus stymied. If more immediate results are needed, real-time\\r\\ncommunication channels such as IRC are better (of course, assuming people are on the\\r\\nchannel: silence sucks on all mediums). Normal end-user and consumer reaction to mailing lists is mixed. Many users have single-shot\\r\\nqueries and questions, and the requirement to battle through the somewhat complex sign-up\\r\\nprocess and then receive all conversations can be off-putting. NOTE\\r\\nAn important consideration to make when setting up a mailing list is whether the\\r\\nlist is archived on the Internet. If you want the conversations to be private (such\\r\\nas if the mailing list is for a governance body), you should close off the archives. We discuss governance in detail in Chapter 10. Discussion forums\\r\\nForums are a very popular, low-barrier-to-entry medium. They manifest in the form of\\r\\nwebsites that allow you to create an identity and have a discussion using that identity.

We will discuss this later in\\r\\nthis chapter and in Chapter 12. Logs\\r\\nIRC channels can be logged, which provides an excellent means of documenting\\r\\ndiscussions and meetings. If you are setting up a community that is focused on technology or the Internet, an IRC channel\\r\\ncould be a useful addition. It is important that your IRC channel is open, accessible, and well\\r\\npublicized. You should ensure that it is listed on your community’s website. NOTE\\r\\nMany IRC services are blocked from commercial work environments, and some of\\r\\nyour members may therefore not be able to take a sneaky IRC break while at work. There are some web-based IRC clients that may solve this problem for those users,\\r\\nand you may want to list some of these alternatives on your community’s website. As with any medium, IRC attracts its own kind of personalities, but the IRC personality profile\\r\\nis fairly mixed. On the one hand, we see many developers making use of IRC every day to keep\\r\\nin touch with their communities. On the other hand, we also see many new users joining IRC. You should ensure that your IRC channel(s) cater to these different types of users. If you are\\r\\nrunning a development project, it is best to have separate channels for developers and users\\r\\n(such as #myproject-dev and #myproject-users, respectively). An interesting personality trait in IRC that you should be aware of is the desire for power. Many communities have discovered that a lot of importance is placed on IRC channel\\r\\nmoderation and control. IRC allows people to become channel operators, and these privileges\\r\\nallow people to be kicked out and banned from channels. Many communities have experienced\\r\\npower struggles, arguments, and bickering over these privileges: being an operator is a badge\\r\\nof honor for many people. You should give out channel privileges sparingly, to those who will\\r\\ntreat those privileges with care. NOT SHOWING POWER\\r\\nIn all IRC channels, some people can be operators and have the power to kick out or ban people\\r\\nfrom the channel.

Leading by Example\\r\\nHowever you decide to lay down the lines of communication and whichever tools and\\r\\nmediums you decide to use, you should strive for communication in your community to be\\r\\nfriendly, clear, and productive. You want your community’s members to not only feel engaged,\\r\\nexcited, and enabled, but also to enjoy their interactions with the rest of the community. This may not be quite as easy as it sounds, however. Communities are, by definition, groups\\r\\nof people, and those people have different personalities, habits, opinions, and approaches. These nuances can sometimes complicate how we communicate. People can and do get frustrated with one another, have mismatched expectations, engage in\\r\\nunclear and tense discussions, and indulge in other agitating agendas. Not only that, but people\\r\\nsometimes just get out of bed on the wrong side. Everyone has bad days. Confusion happens. Life will get in the way, and people get busy. Many of these causes are entirely innocent and simply the nature of being human. With people\\r\\nbeing the catalyst of community, you could be forgiven for thinking that there is nothing we\\r\\ncan do about these problems in communication. Not so. Communities are vessels of culture: every community has its own norms, and these norms are\\r\\ndefined by community leaders—community leaders such as you. You can avoid many of these\\r\\npotential issues in communication by not only setting a strong example, but also inspiring the\\r\\nwider community to follow a positive example in how they communicate with one another.

It is about inspiring your community to get behind\\r\\nan ethic of good communication and ensuring that your community is exposed to that ethic\\r\\non a daily basis. Life has taught us that consistent exposure to high-quality content can\\r\\nengender a high-quality response among onlookers.

Great communication\\r\\ninstead focuses on clarity, detail, objective thought, and a consistently high quality of\\r\\ninteraction. Teaching great communication is complex, and many books have been written on the subject. Fortunately, becoming a great communicator doesn’t require an exercise in academically\\r\\nsatisfying hand waving or an attempt to sound like a monocle-wearing intellectual, but to\\r\\nsimply be clear, friendly, and straightforward in your communications. To achieve this, there are two stages involved. First, you should familiarize yourself with some\\r\\nsimple recommended rules of engagement. These are:\\r\\nBe clear\\r\\nAlways try to communicate as clearly and transparently as possible. Speak frankly and use\\r\\nlanguage familiar to your recipient. Try not to blind people with science, but don’t\\r\\npatronize them either. Always try to craft your communications to your audience. Be concise\\r\\nKeep to the point, and don’t weigh your communications down with babble. Don’t use\\r\\n1,000 words to say what could be said in 100. With many of us receiving so many emails,\\r\\nmessages, phone calls, and other distractions every day, don’t burden your community\\r\\nwith unnecessary rambling. If an email takes longer than five minutes to type, you may\\r\\nbe doing something wrong (or you are a really, really slow typist). Be responsive\\r\\nYou don’t have to be wedded to your computer, but try to get back to people within a few\\r\\ndays of them getting in touch with you. If you are drowning in emails and work, just let\\r\\npeople know you might be a little delayed, so their expectations are set correctly. This\\r\\nissue is applicable not just to personal communication directed to you and other\\r\\ncommunity leaders, but also to mailing lists, forums, IRC, and other public channels. Put\\r\\nyourself in the sender’s position: it is impossible to tell the difference between “nobody is\\r\\nanswering my question because nobody knows the answer, meaning that what I’m trying\\r\\nto do is impossible and I should try something else” and “nobody is answering my question\\r\\neven though everyone knows the answer, because everybody is too busy, meaning that I\\r\\nshould sit and wait longer rather than abandoning this approach.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2162cc29-657b-4255-8156-676e8eae6368":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2162cc29-657b-4255-8156-676e8eae6368\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"ACAS0AWZad+kShQcgc0mAVk2H7/oBSsOVEZUuMtofz4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Kd84nYbCuEUbRC5ePAZjp3mNzPyvUw13Wc7a5rSbsbk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"155582d2-c29b-4067-a51c-72e484692557\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"cft8xekmeVA+6IeW4UdgYcnzRJ6KfaGu+G8io0XCoVk=\"}},\"hash\":\"wy8Pjf2F18+JJXxUf0KT9KRPN1XMfzjIpLih6eOdbA8=\",\"text\":\"” It helps to make your\\r\\ncommunity seem friendlier to new members and outsiders if they can tell the difference\\r\\nbetween these two things.

The second step is to learn from others. Observe email, chat conversations, phone discussions,\\r\\nand other interactions, and deconstruct them in your mind to find nuggets of wisdom and\\r\\ninspiration. You are sure to find some people who are always clear, concise, and detailed in\\r\\ntheir communications, and these are excellent role models for you.

All that needs to happen now is to turn those dreams into\\r\\nreality, right? Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple. Talking is always easier than doing. It is far easier to discuss a great idea (often in exhaustive\\r\\ndetail) than to implement a great idea. Reams and reams of discussion from many interested\\r\\nparties can explode on your mailing list, but this in itself can be a blocker to producing the very\\r\\nprojects you discuss. While up-front specifications can help communities build something,\\r\\noverspecification and information overflow can have the inverse effect. Part of the problem is that many communities focus a little too much on having every “i” dotted\\r\\nand every “t” crossed before work begins. The issue here is twofold. First, too much discussion\\r\\nwill typically result in a hugely complex plan that is difficult to keep track of if not well\\r\\ndocumented. This can be off-putting for volunteers who just want to get started with something\\r\\nfun and manageable. When you overdiscuss and overengineer an idea, the complexity can be\\r\\ndaunting. The second problem, particularly in the early stages of your community, is that your new\\r\\nmembers need to see results or they will grow bored and leave. A great community is often\\r\\nbuilt by a small set of capable and fast-moving contributors right at the beginning of its\\r\\nevolution. If a community spends three months discussing an idea yet produces little or\\r\\nnothing, many potential contributors will grow impatient with the discussion and develop a\\r\\nsense that the community is nothing more than a talking shop. This is exactly what we want\\r\\nto avoid. There are two approaches that can help prevent this problem from occurring. First, you should\\r\\nnot discuss topics in too much detail without connecting them to specific plans. Ask who is\\r\\ngoing to work on what, when the work is likely to be completed, and how you can help. As\\r\\nan example, if you are working on a software project, you should aim to have some code\\r\\nwritten within a week of the project starting. Always keep your eyes on the prize: reaching the\\r\\ngoals of the community, be it software, an event, a campaign, or whatever else.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3d9e0a13-3f8d-4ad3-a036-718b4a25416d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3d9e0a13-3f8d-4ad3-a036-718b4a25416d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"j2Cy38KnxR4ZpZtZ+UQhq1QRcAiVVr1zyr/eIP4fHnY=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"nCHcF3/tVvWn37kWfAz0xTzPysaLN2SbxoV07LKoyhE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"913af6b7-0e01-4e46-9a83-3b3562ac93b2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"iOt1Phg2PECIVe4oGzOHNSewmTxt1jysi0Y9TRJP2io=\"}},\"hash\":\"O9JzWB/H2QTQYVny6Aa//ntPlgzrpeurq/9E11yITlg=\",\"text\":\"Another solution is to build a culture of experiments in which your members channel their\\r\\nenergy into a specific project that can be proposed to your community at a later date.

At this level we\\r\\nare absolutely focused on the nuts and bolts of writing: spelling, grammar, and punctuation. For some people this is the be-all and end-all of communication: producing “perfect writing”\\r\\nthat follows strong editorial guidelines. Using our previous “It’s not the notes you play, it’s the\\r\\nnotes you don’t play” quote with which I opened this chapter, the mechanics of writing are\\r\\nour metaphorical notes. Though it is absolutely not the be-all and end-all, writing in a “correct”\\r\\nway does offer a baseline that all writers should build on. Producing fantastically literate,\\r\\nillustrative, and textured writing just doesn’t work if your spelling and grammar suck. To achieve this baseline, I recommend grabbing a good book on the topic. There are plenty to\\r\\nchoose from, but don’t feel you need to devote your life to it: pick a short book that covers the\\r\\nmain points, digest it, and use some of the advice it presents. A great read that I recommend\\r\\nfor those of you who want to brush up on this is Strunk and White’s classic The Elements of\\r\\nStyle (Longman). While you read and learn the topics, also look at other people’s writing and\\r\\ntry to learn what makes their writing structurally interesting and simple to read. If there is one piece of advice I would recommend more than any other, it is to proofread your\\r\\nwork extensively. Proofreading offers an excellent chance to read the piece and ensure that it\\r\\nstructurally fits together. Let’s use this chapter as an example. If you take a look at the range of content that is covered,\\r\\nit has been laid out in a very specific way. The content has been structured to discuss different\\r\\ntopics, each building on what went before. As I write these words right now, I have already\\r\\nwritten a significant chunk of content for the chapter, and although I could proofread this\\r\\nspecific section on “The mechanics of writing,” I need to proofread the entire chapter to ensure\\r\\nthat this section fits in and flows correctly.

Setting tone\\r\\nTone is an important element in all writing. Tone is the impression and “feel” that you take\\r\\naway from a piece based on how it is written. Tone can often be subtle and entirely subjective\\r\\nin how it is interpreted. Let’s look at an example. Here are two different ways of writing a piece\\r\\nasking people to write reports about their work, each with a very different approach to the tone:\\r\\nWay 1\\r\\nHi, everyone!\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"51695d37-f928-4dbb-84e0-d7fc7ea8600c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"51695d37-f928-4dbb-84e0-d7fc7ea8600c\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"acWkqFtaGHptv1Zpr6pz0ezzYC3ZeNJYzsRyivRmVIM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"7cgA66iOlvPpNfCR+O+hPvvAEreaRoCJF/m8LpOl4vs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f394a594-a8be-4da3-b85a-0fb485dd2977\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"vPrrdOIn627EuDQod+cCqkLxVL8wX2F8n3avxw+PCKc=\"}},\"hash\":\"1C/9/WGo7vEyJS6lROi0UGcZROAbnWL/SJGE6l0qdR0=\",\"text\":\"As our community continues to grow and rock the world, it is difficult to\\r\\nkeep track of what we are all working on.

Could everyone please produce a series of reports for their work to facilitate the\\r\\ncommunity in understanding which work is being tended to? Thank you. With the first piece the tone is very open, friendly, and participatory. The language is loose,\\r\\nand the writing openly asks for comments and feedback. The second piece is far more formal,\\r\\nand a little more demanding in asking people to provide reports. Although both are clearly\\r\\nwritten, the choice of words and structure affects the tone. Tone is hugely important when writing content for your community. Following on with our\\r\\n“notes you play” quote, it is tone that is the finest example of “the notes you don’t play. ” The\\r\\ntone you choose can hugely affect how the piece is interpreted. There are two different elements to consider when thinking about the tone of your writing:\\r\\nGeneral tone\\r\\nOne of the most important considerations to make with your writing is the general tone\\r\\nthat you use throughout your communications. For most of us this is baked in: your tone\\r\\nis expressed each time you write, and it largely reflects your general personality. You\\r\\nshould endeavor for your tone to be loose, open, friendly, and inviting. You should feel\\r\\nentirely comfortable about mixing in humor, and you should write in a way that makes\\r\\nyour community feel like equals. Context-specific tone\\r\\nDepending on the context, you will need to adjust your tone to be appropriate. The choice\\r\\nof tone varies significantly between contexts that involve conflict, getting people excited,\\r\\nand governance topics. Your choice of tone and how you apply it will significantly affect how you are perceived in the\\r\\ncommunity. This choice does require balance, though: being too happy-go-lucky can have the\\r\\nsame effect as being a grumpy curmudgeon. Imagine a line drawn in the sand in front of you. On the far left of the line is an overly chirpy,\\r\\noverly friendly, and potentially disingenuous level of bright smiles and happy thoughts. On\\r\\nthe far right side of the line is a grumpy, monotonic, miserable, and snappy approach.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"37674e2c-d71e-41e3-867e-f5815f2d1874":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"37674e2c-d71e-41e3-867e-f5815f2d1874\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"am/qpnMqNmLMhSFsRKWTM9B9+GKqRTC4bWGcp+KchcU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"uwztAhgJvno/XEXHFtTRd/zxOzDKbso5VJFO7opVkFw=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6f39e189-6e08-4be1-a4ba-3ce296c3ea1b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"PIf6u+OKlaurp+bZlpmf1ovtVCppFTHalstqkPdZpOI=\"}},\"hash\":\"rNwj1JRTVKsN3D5EdxRKVl8YtWaTlydJDKMI6v26gSw=\",\"text\":\"Although\\r\\nit is easy to see how those on the far right will rattle people’s cages, those on the far left create\\r\\nnot only potential annoyance and frustration, but also mistrust: if someone is over-the-top\\r\\nhappy in his communication to everyone, it could be interpreted that the person is doing it for\\r\\neffect and not being honest with the community.

As a general rule,\\r\\nyou should keep your community loose and informal, but at times you will need to be\\r\\nserious and focused. You should fully expect a more serious tone when discussing conflict,\\r\\ngovernance topics, or personal problems with a specific community member. Humor\\r\\nHumor is a huge boon when used correctly with community. If you are funny, your\\r\\ncommunity will likely take to you, but your humor needs to (a) actually work (yes, you\\r\\nneed to actually be funny) and (b) not distract the audience from the topic. You need to\\r\\nalways ensure that your humor matches the context. For example, humor in an\\r\\nemergency meeting will probably go down like a lead balloon. Wit\\r\\nClosely related to humor is wit. If you are quick-witted, particularly in an amusing way,\\r\\nit can bring a loose and fun atmosphere to your community. One risk you should be aware\\r\\nof, though, is to not use your lightning-fast wit to embarrass or show up a fellow\\r\\ncommunity member. Also, wit is typically not very welcome in contentious or\\r\\nargumentative scenarios, so tread carefully there. Frankness\\r\\nBeing frank and to the point can be received in many different ways. Some people who\\r\\nreceive this kind of to-the-point approach will respond with a very defensive and\\r\\nconfrontational tone, whereas others will relish your frankness. Take the pulse of the\\r\\npeople you are talking to, and adjust this element of tone based on how well you think\\r\\nthey will react. Your choices and approach to tone will adjust, grow, and mature over time. As with everything\\r\\nelse when working on your communication, it is always valuable to look below the surface of\\r\\nother people’s communications to learn how they have approached situations. As an example,\\r\\nif you are dealing with a contentious situation, look at the tone of how others have responded\\r\\nand learn from them.

Faking self-deprecation just\\r\\nsounds patronizing. Inspiring your community\\r\\nOne of the most fundamental qualities that a community leader can bring to a community is\\r\\ninspiration. At their heart, communities are collections of people united by a shared ethos and\\r\\nmost typically by a shared opportunity and goal. Not only does inspiration bolster everyone’s\\r\\ncommitment and excitement around that goal, but it can also build a sense of unity and\\r\\ntogetherness that is essential for a thriving community. Unfortunately, there is no recipe or formula that teaches you how to inspire. Inspiration is a\\r\\nhugely complex topic to teach, because it is heavily dependent on your approach and the kind\\r\\nof community that you have. Part of the reason for this is that your approach is, in itself, also\\r\\nhighly dependent on you as a human being. Being able to inspire is based heavily on whether you are believable as an inspirational figure,\\r\\nand your approach needs to reflect you as a person. As an example, if you are a generally fun,\\r\\njovial person but try to deliver a Winston Churchill monologue, it will be laughable at best and\\r\\nseen as a desperate attempt for validation at worst. On the flip side, if you are a serious and\\r\\nforthright person and you deliver a George Carlin-style comedic slap-down, your audience will\\r\\nprobably feel the same way they do when they see their dads edging toward the dance floor\\r\\nat a wedding. You need to match the approach to inspiration with what qualities and attributes\\r\\nyou as a person already have. When you make inspiration your own, it becomes other people’s\\r\\ninspiration. The best advice I have for writing inspirationally is to discover who and what inspires you and\\r\\nlearn from it. Everyone has his own individual answer to this question. Some are inspired by\\r\\nmusicians, authors, politicians, and people related to their field of interest or expertise. For me,\\r\\none of my most significant inspirations is the unique combination of Aaron Sorkin and Martin\\r\\nSheen. Sorkin was the writing genius behind The West Wing, a show written about the goings-on of an\\r\\nAmerican administration in the West Wing of the White House.

With this solid chunk of great communication best practice under our belts, let’s continue our\\r\\napplication of simplicity to community by applying it to an area often bastardized by utter\\r\\ncomplexity: building processes.

His machines allowed anyone with rudimentary operating abilities to create a\\r\\ndelicious, creamy milkshake that was so thick it required the power of a thousand vacuum\\r\\ncleaners to suck it up the straw. Kroc’s machines were a hit, and it wasn’t long before his path crossed with that of Dick and\\r\\nMac McDonald, owners of a small restaurant chain called McDonald’s. A partnership was born,\\r\\nbut Kroc’s ambitions went way beyond milkshake-making machines. His ambitions also went\\r\\nway beyond those of Dick and Mac.

McDonald’s\\r\\nlow cost in terms of staff is a key area in which it competes effectively—but how does it do it? Like Henry Ford before it, McDonald’s has broken complex processes into sets of steps that\\r\\nalmost anyone can replicate. If you were going to cook fries at home, you’d have to consider\\r\\na lot of variables: the time it takes to heat the oil, how small you need to cut the potatoes,\\r\\ncooking time, how much salt to sprinkle on top of the fries, and how to avoid inadvertently\\r\\nplunging your hand in the oil (an ever-present risk when I am in the kitchen). McDonald’s\\r\\nhas eliminated the need for this range of knowledge by converting the cooking process into a\\r\\nseries of simpler steps: unpacking boxes, filling containers, pressing buttons, and so on.

The word\\r\\nprocess is unspecific: it describes a set of steps that achieves something. For newcomers to the\\r\\nsubject, this is difficult to get your head around without specific examples of processes. This\\r\\ncould include the examples we just spoke of: how new people join your community, submit\\r\\ncontributions, collaborate, and deal with conflict. When thinking of how to approach this chapter, as well as the wider book, I am keen to not\\r\\nmerely provide you with answers to specific problems. This reminds me of the old Chinese\\r\\nproverb:\\r\\nGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. I want to teach you all how to fish. I want the content in this book to help you grow and build\\r\\nbest practices that can be applied in a range of scenarios. This absolutely applies to processes. But this brings us back to our original conundrum: processes can be a little abstract and difficult\\r\\nto understand if not accompanied by an example. As such, as you read this chapter always\\r\\nconsider how you can apply the content to the examples we discussed earlier, such as\\r\\nencouraging new members into your project. Throughout this chapter we will discuss how to build processes that are smooth and effective,\\r\\nexplore what is important to consider when building them, identify our needs, and document\\r\\nand communicate them in our community. Keeping Things in Perspective\\r\\nRight now I can imagine that some of you are not exactly exhilarated at the idea of reading a\\r\\nchapter all about processes. I admit that even I, while planning this book, was initially hesitant\\r\\nabout devoting a chapter to processes. Some of you may see processes as a waste of time, an\\r\\noverly formal mind game that makes life less fun for everyone involved.

The Impact of Processes\\r\\nShortly after I joined Canonical in 2006 I underwent an experience that changed the way I\\r\\nsaw my role as a community manager and how I build effective processes. I was working at home one day when I got an email that told a stunning story. The sender was\\r\\na kid (unfortunately, I can’t remember his name) who was living with his family in a remote\\r\\nregion of Africa. Some time ago some visitors had come to his village and these visitors had\\r\\nlaptops that were running Ubuntu (the software we produce at Canonical). When the kid asked these people what was on their computers and they mentioned Ubuntu,\\r\\nit immediately resonated: the word ubuntu is an ancient African word meaning “humanity to\\r\\nothers. ” This piqued the kid’s interest and he asked for more information about the software. They then told him how the software was entirely open and created by a global community\\r\\nwho worked together to create software that people could share with one another. Although\\r\\nthe kid had spent little time in front of computers (he didn’t own one and had no access to the\\r\\nInternet), he was absolutely fascinated by the premise of Ubuntu and open source and this\\r\\nculture of sharing. He felt compelled to participate. He told me that, to earn money, on weekdays he would do odd jobs and bits of work around\\r\\nhis village when he was not at school, and then on the weekends he would walk three hours\\r\\nto the nearest town and spend his money in an Internet café, where he would pay for an hour’s\\r\\nworth of Internet time and use it to contribute to Ubuntu. After his hour was up he would\\r\\nwalk three hours back to his village, excited about his contributions. He did this every weekend\\r\\nand told me that all week he would look forward to the weekend to contribute to Ubuntu. I was moved by this email. Not only did it demonstrate the sheer humanity and good nature\\r\\nof this kid, but it also demonstrated how powerful inspiration and community can move\\r\\npeople.

And of course, any interaction with the\\r\\ngovernment...well, I am sure you can end that sentence yourself. Unfortunately, many people\\r\\nwho interact with processes experience little reward for a lot of frustration. Processes are like television news: we only ever hear the negative stories.

Whether nuts contaminated a nut-free zone, pieces of glass broke into\\r\\na large vat of baby food, or a batch of eggs was exposed to salmonella, product recalls point the\\r\\ngiant finger of blame in the general direction of the manufacturing process.

It is easy to sometimes get lost in the details\\r\\nand forget some of our wider ambitions. To complement our approach to fleshing out process criteria, let us now explore some of the\\r\\nkey themes that make good processes. These key themes should be at the forefront of our\\r\\nminds while we work. Simplicity is key\\r\\nLife is pretty complex, and modern technology seems to exacerbate as much as relieve that\\r\\ncomplexity. Take the now-somewhat-archaic example of the VCR. For years, thousands tried\\r\\nto set their VCR to achieve a seemingly simple task: tape a show at a specific time. Unfortunately, many of us failed. We heard endless horror stories of missed tapings of Falcon\\r\\nCrest, Days of Our Lives, and other such travesties (sounds like a blessing in disguise to me). VCRs\\r\\nseemed to just confuse the heck out of many of us. There are similar examples: car\\r\\nentertainment systems, computer software, automated ticketing machines in parking garages,\\r\\nand online banking, to name a few.

As a critical component in\\r\\nthe Linux desktop, xFree86 was holding everyone back. It was a real mess. Unfortunately, the bylaws of the community stated that any changes in governance had to be\\r\\ninitiated by the directors of the xFree86 Corporation. This was a problem.

Each of those chapters helps you build effective processes in those respective\\r\\nareas using the best practices described in this chapter. So let’s now talk through some of the environment-related concepts that are important in our\\r\\ncommunity. This will give you some handy examples that you can apply to your own\\r\\ncommunity. Community Cycles\\r\\nMost communities, particularly collaborative ones, require some kind of planning cycle. Whether you are working toward a software release, a conference, a local event, or something\\r\\nelse, planning is key. Many of these objectives are reoccurring. Software regularly has releases. Events regularly\\r\\noccur. In addition to this regularity, there are regular milestones that need to be completed to\\r\\nachieve the objectives. One such example is software. Most software releases adhere to the following broad set of\\r\\nmilestones:\\r\\n1. Development begins. 2. Feature freeze. 3. User interface freeze. 4. Beta freeze.

The Gates of Your Community\\r\\nNow let’s take a look at another item on our TODO list. Community TODO List\\r\\n• Attract a diverse range of contributors. Attracting new contributors is an essential part of any community. Earlier we used this item\\r\\nas an example in fleshing out a description of our process. I want to now explore this important\\r\\nitem in more detail. In attracting contributors, our goal is not merely to get the word out; it is about getting the\\r\\nword out to the right people and ensuring that they can join us in achieving our goals. In this work we have two primary outcomes that we want to achieve:\\r\\n•To ensure that the on-ramp from consumer of buzz to full-fledged community member is\\r\\nas smooth as possible\\r\\n•   To attract community members who will demonstrate commitment and a willingness to\\r\\nwork toward the goals of the community\\r\\nThe first point may seem obvious, but the second is subtler. What we want to avoid are drive-\\r\\nby contributors. These are people who join a community for a few weeks, you help them get\\r\\nup and running, and they then get bored and move on. Drive-by contributors are expensive, not necessarily financially, but in terms of time. Contributors often require a certain level of (wo)manpower. The community responds to their\\r\\nquestions and provides the help, guidance, training, and mentorship needed to get them on\\r\\ntheir feet. If these contributors receive this assistance and fail to deliver anything of value, they\\r\\nbecome expensive propositions. Animal welfare communities have dealt with this for years. Cristina Verduzco is the volunteer/\\r\\noutreach manager for the East Bay and Tri-Valley SPCA. Cristina is responsible for recruiting,\\r\\ntraining, and managing volunteers. She is responsible for all facets of the volunteer program,\\r\\ncoordination and planning of multiple events, and coordination of mobile adoptions.

Cristina told me she is fully aware of the biggest risk to\\r\\nretention:\\r\\nRetaining volunteers will always be a problem for any animal welfare organization. While the\\r\\nwork is rewarding, it can also be difficult. We are fortunate that our euthanasia rates are lower\\r\\nthan almost all other shelters, as we don’t euthanize animals for lack of space. While it is common\\r\\nthat issues around euthanasia tend to be a big reason for people not to return, we don’t see that\\r\\nquite as often at our shelter. Every community is strained by push and pull forces that will affect your ability to retain\\r\\nvolunteers. This will apply equally in your community. For the SPCA, euthanasia is clearly a\\r\\nblocker for many to get involved. What is your equivalent blocker? This could be difficult\\r\\npersonalities, suboptimal working conditions, hugely complex processes and technical\\r\\nprocedures, or anything else. You should identify these blockers and ensure that you have resources to help people over the\\r\\nhump.

Your focus\\r\\nshould be on sustained contributions, no matter how long each contribution lasts. If your\\r\\ncontributors put in three hours a week every week, that is an excellent gift to your community. This gift is also far better than two days of frenetic full-time contribution and then nothing else. 112   CHAPTER FOUR\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a8bbd5f6-af18-40b0-9b38-b80d689e827b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a8bbd5f6-af18-40b0-9b38-b80d689e827b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"TjL00HPQIS6X+Jl2SNNCblcE+wk+04d3uIe+X4bhWhs=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"9pbNg/tzL/cfX0tFF8JPRGLg2O327muRX3BPquEAXpg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e2169a83-cdda-4246-a41c-2d17c411756d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"QonWIp4GBtrpJ8fIlLO3e331KVhbgdIcrFvK9/sD7ik=\"}},\"hash\":\"aCvUuOKL7ZfpTnAtlqEWH52ct4a6147r8z+Hxs8U75w=\",\"text\":\"Retaining contributors sounds complex, but is thankfully pretty simple. If you want people to\\r\\nstick around, you need to offer them a regular sense of achievement. Your community members\\r\\nneed to feel (a) that they are productive, (b) that their contributions are appreciated, and (c)\\r\\nthat (a) and (b) happen repeatedly. This is particularly important for new contributors. When someone first expresses interest in\\r\\njoining your community, she needs to follow what I call the contributor ramp:\\r\\n•   Identify an area in which she can contribute\\r\\n•   Learn the skills required to contribute\\r\\n•   Know which specific task to work on\\r\\n•   Know how to submit her work\\r\\nWhen you start attracting people to your community, you are encouraging them to begin\\r\\ninterfacing with this process. As such, you need to make sure you have all of the above in order\\r\\nbefore you even make a peep. The most logical home for this information is your website. Assessing Contributors\\r\\nMany collaborative projects embody some kind of access control. In a typical open source\\r\\nproject, those who can contribute code are restricted, and developers are assigned a username\\r\\nand password to contribute code to the repository. The reason is simple: you don’t want just\\r\\nanyone changing the project. The integrity of the code base is essential. You always want your\\r\\ncode to run, be as error-free as possible, and maintain consistent coding guidelines. If access\\r\\nwere entirely open, those with malicious intentions or error-prone (in)abilities could introduce\\r\\nbugs, defects, and security flaws to your project. Having a vetting process is important to ensure\\r\\nthat your developers can be trusted and will demonstrate this level of quality. As we briefly discussed earlier in this chapter, it is important for us to figure out how new\\r\\npotential developers can gain access to the project. If I want to contribute to an open source\\r\\nproject and am unknown, how do I prove my abilities? The first task is to assess what your expectations of quality are. For many open source projects,\\r\\nthey are relatively simple:\\r\\n•   A reasonable knowledge of programming; the contributor should not be making the\\r\\nobvious mistakes that new developers make. •   A familiarity with the code base and coding conventions. •   A regularity of contribution.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e2169a83-cdda-4246-a41c-2d17c411756d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e2169a83-cdda-4246-a41c-2d17c411756d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"TjL00HPQIS6X+Jl2SNNCblcE+wk+04d3uIe+X4bhWhs=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"9pbNg/tzL/cfX0tFF8JPRGLg2O327muRX3BPquEAXpg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a8bbd5f6-af18-40b0-9b38-b80d689e827b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"aCvUuOKL7ZfpTnAtlqEWH52ct4a6147r8z+Hxs8U75w=\"}},\"hash\":\"QonWIp4GBtrpJ8fIlLO3e331KVhbgdIcrFvK9/sD7ik=\",\"text\":\"•   A regularity of contribution.

One of the most\\r\\neffective methods of determining whether your processes are really as simple as you think they are\\r\\nis the “elevator pitch. ” This is easy to test. Imagine you are out having a drink with some friends and talking about your community. One of\\r\\nthem asks how he can get involved. To pass the test, you should be able to recite your process and\\r\\nhave him understand it within a minute. If the person you are speaking to stumbles on any part of the process or needs it reexplained, your\\r\\nprocess needs some work. Reviewing new developers: In depth\\r\\nAd Hoc Peer Review is common in the open source world. Here is how it works: you have an\\r\\nexisting member of the community review a new contributor’s proposed contribution, and if\\r\\nit is acceptable, the existing member will commit it on the new contributor’s behalf. As an example, imagine Adam would like to fix a bug in the OpenOffice.org project. He grabs\\r\\nthe code, programs a solution to the bug, and then sends an existing OpenOffice.org developer\\r\\nthe fix. That developer (let’s call him Michael) then reviews the fix, and if it is suitable, he\\r\\ncommits the fix to the main OpenOffice.org code base. Typically this process would be repeated until each proposed contribution from Adam is almost\\r\\ncertainly going to be accepted by Michael. At this point, Adam would be given direct developer\\r\\naccess to the source code repository. A range of projects use this approach. One such project is Jokosher, which was mentioned\\r\\nearlier in Chapter 2. When the project first started, a new contributor called Laszlo Pandy\\r\\nwanted to get involved. He joined the IRC chat channel to express his interest and was asked\\r\\nto submit some patches (small bundles of code changes). To make this as easy as possible for\\r\\nnew contributors, we had written a web page that explained how this worked. I reviewed some of his patches. With each one, I provided him technical feedback: areas that\\r\\nworked, elements that needed fixing, and so on. When Laszlo’s patches were of sufficient\\r\\nquality (which required only minor adjustments), I committed them for him.

It is important that this feedback is not held\\r\\nup due to having only a limited set of contributors who are able to provide it. Every\\r\\ncontribution should be seen as a gift, and as such should rightly expect feedback, even if\\r\\nthis feedback is just “This is excellent work, I have committed this. ”\\r\\n•There needs to be a method of tracking these recurring contributions. If a new contributor\\r\\nhas contributed three or four excellent patches that have been committed with few or no\\r\\nchanges, you need a means of identifying this recurring quality. This could be as informal\\r\\nas some core contributors keeping a mental note of the new contributions, or as formal as\\r\\nmaintaining a written log of contributions. Although this approach has been described here within the context of providing code\\r\\ncontributions, this could equally apply to other types of contributions, such as documentation,\\r\\nart, and translations. For nontechnical projects, a similar approach can involve simply reviewing prior work by the\\r\\ncontributor. If you are organizing a local community event and you want a contributor to do\\r\\nthe art for the brochure, you could ask him to produce some initial drafts, make sure they’re\\r\\nacceptable, and then accept the contributor as the brochure artist. Unfortunately, for some larger communities (particularly large open source projects), the\\r\\nprevious approach is unsuitable. This can be due to a number of reasons:\\r\\n•   The technical requirements involved for the new contributor are too complex to be\\r\\nassessed in a loose and ad hoc way. •   There are too many new contributors submitting content for the existing developers to\\r\\nassess in a timely manner. •The project is hugely popular, touching thousands or even millions of users, and as such,\\r\\ngranted access needs to be more rigorously assessed. Although the core technique of reviewing proposed contributions does not change with a more\\r\\nformalized approach (having people check a contribution before it is committed), what does\\r\\nchange is how you track and review those contributions.

In the Ubuntu community, we have a little more formality in how\\r\\nnew contributors can gain access to one of our key repositories, Universe. Our guiding policy\\r\\nhas always been that new contributors should demonstrate a significant and sustained\\r\\ncontribution. That is what we seek to assess in new contributors. The Universe repository is a large collection of applications that are packaged by volunteers. These applications are not officially supported by the Canonical technical support service, and\\r\\nthey don’t receive security updates. The members who work on these packages are called\\r\\nMOTUs (short for Masters of the Universe). The MOTU community is led by the MOTU\\r\\nCouncil, a small group of well-respected MOTU contributors. Although more formalized, the process is still relatively simple:\\r\\n1.New contributors make their contribution by attaching a patch to a bug report. They then\\r\\nsubscribe the ubuntu-universe-sponsors team to the bug report. The collection of bugs\\r\\nsubscribed to that team is called the Sponsorship Queue. 2.The team looks at each patch, reviews them, offers feedback, and, where suitable, uploads\\r\\nthe changes. 3.This process repeats a number of times to demonstrate the sustainability of contributions\\r\\nfrom a given contributor. 4.After a number of contributions have been made, an existing MOTU will often recommend\\r\\nthat the contributor apply for MOTU approval. 5.Candidates prepare a wiki page outlining the contributions they have made to the project\\r\\nand also some endorsement statements from existing MOTUs to approve their application. 6.The application is reviewed by the MOTU Council and then approved where appropriate. The MOTU community’s approach has been refined over the years. At its heart, new\\r\\ncontributors add their contribution to a queue, go through review, and then apply to the MOTU\\r\\nCouncil. The only differences are the sponsorship queue and the approval process, which make\\r\\nthe approach more formalized.

As Ubuntu has grown and is\\r\\nnow used on millions of computers around the world, the list of reported bugs has grown, too. After fleshing out a number of different possible approaches and plans, we announced a new\\r\\nscheme called 5-A-Day. The idea was inspired by the popular meme of eating five portions of\\r\\nfruit or vegetables every day to stay healthy. I wanted to apply this concept to software bugs:\\r\\nencouraging everyone in the Ubuntu community to work on five bugs every day. This would\\r\\nmake our bug list, and resultantly Ubuntu, healthier, too. The response was stunning. Many contributors got involved, and thousands of bugs received\\r\\nattention. Many of our contributors didn’t stop at five bugs, though; they were often nailing\\r\\nupward of 20 or 30 a day. Some were even hitting 100 a day. These people were bug-squashing\\r\\nmachines. Ten months later, at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in California, I scheduled a session to\\r\\nreview 5-A-Day. I was keen to gather feedback and opinions about the initiative and how we\\r\\ncould improve it. In the session, a friend of mine called Robert Collins raised a valid point: in\\r\\nmeasuring 5-A-Day, we were measuring the wrong things.

The documentation behind\\r\\na process should be as close as possible to a cooking recipe: do this...do that...get this result. The emphasis here is on quick, clear, straight-to-the-point directions. Processes are fundamentally a collection of steps with an outcome. Documenting them is\\r\\nsimilar to Ikea’s instructions for putting together a shelving unit. How can you tell the user\\r\\nhow to achieve the outcome as easily and effectively as possible?

Although I would recommend using text for most communities’ processes,\\r\\nthe Ikea model is cathartic and helps focus your mind on the right goal of reducing clutter. To get you started, let’s get introspective for a while and document your own steps for writing\\r\\na process:\\r\\n1. First, write down the end goal of your process. What does it achieve? 2. Now, in numerical and chronological order, write down each step in your process, using\\r\\na single word to describe each step. 3. Finally, for each word, write a single sentence that clearly explains what is involved in\\r\\nthe step. As an example, the following could be used to develop a process for a new developer\\r\\ncontributing a patch to a project:\\r\\nGOAL: Achieving contributor access in the FooBar project. PRODUCE: Produce a patch with a new feature or bug fix that can apply to the latest\\r\\ndevelopment version of the code. SUBMIT: Send the patch to the FooBar project mailing list outlining what it does. WAIT: Wait for feedback on the patch and, if required, make adjustments. Otherwise, the\\r\\npatch will be submitted. REPEAT: Repeat the above steps until a developer considers your contributions consistent\\r\\nenough to offer you direct access to the repository. When following through with this approach, always read and reread each step, and assess how\\r\\neasy it is to understand. Is it written concisely? Does it use too much jargon? Would it be\\r\\nsuitable as an elevator pitch? Make Them Easy to Find\\r\\nProcesses don’t have any value when no one knows that they exist. In addition to ensuring\\r\\nthat your processes are clearly written, you should work hard to ensure that they are\\r\\ndiscoverable. Our goal here is to ensure that community members can find our documented\\r\\nprocesses easily. This is a two-step approach:\\r\\n1. You need to put your documentation somewhere online that people can refer to. 2.You need to inform your community about additions and changes to the documentation\\r\\nwhen they happen. The first step involves putting your process somewhere accessible. If it makes sense, you should\\r\\nput it with the rest of the strategic documentation that we discussed earlier in the book. Discoverability is the key here, though. 120   CHAPTER FOUR\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"38f734ab-0a16-4e8c-9926-3bf234ad8079":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"38f734ab-0a16-4e8c-9926-3bf234ad8079\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/7eNgNnfphzNqijWfuz9dl5FD8HAxkxY3HKRX0+L464=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"60NkDG6JsY5XyT8LXbxs6BORVEFCQ1YV78l7SoFlqrI=\"}},\"hash\":\"HUxeE8oQMgqhQfpyQfQjTJgwpXGQreQK1z803eWyfoE=\",\"text\":\"As an example, if you have a process that new contributors should use to gain repository access,\\r\\nyou should make sure new contributors can find it.

The link to the location will be referenced extensively, particularly in online communities. If you need to move your documentation, you should ensure that the old link redirects to the new\\r\\ndocumentation. The referenceable integrity of your documentation is something you should always\\r\\nendeavor to maintain, even if your documentation moves. The next step is to announce the new process documentation to your community. Earlier in\\r\\nthis book, we discussed communication channels within your community, and you should use\\r\\nthese channels to announce this documentation and encourage your community to make use\\r\\nof it. When you announce your processes, you should include the following details:\\r\\n•   The problem you sought to solve\\r\\n•   A single paragraph overview of the process and how it works\\r\\n•   A link to the online documentation that explains how the process works\\r\\n•   A final paragraph that strongly encourages the community to make use of the process\\r\\nWhen announcing new processes, you should tread carefully.

Although this sounds obvious, it is easy to forget this important first component of the on-\\r\\nramp when we are so busy and knee-deep in building processes, tracking their effectiveness,\\r\\nand dealing with problems and other work. Part of the challenge here are the different levels of abstraction in your community. As an\\r\\nexample, in the Ubuntu community we have many different teams: documentation writers,\\r\\ntranslators, packagers, bug triagers, and more. At a team level we have generally had the bases\\r\\ncovered here; each team would have a website which made it clear that everyone is welcome\\r\\nto participate in her respective team. We went to great lengths to ensure that all the major\\r\\nteams had these pages in place and that new folks who would express an interest in a team\\r\\nwould know their participation is desired and encouraged. While this served us well at the team level, it was also important for us to do this at the higher\\r\\ngeneral community level for people who were literally brand-new to Ubuntu and had no idea\\r\\nhow the community works. In these cases people had typically tried Ubuntu and were curious\\r\\nabout it, and we needed to inform them about how Ubuntu is a collaborative community and\\r\\nanyone can participate. This work was best done by highlighting the many different types of\\r\\ncontributions and how these contributions typically map to teams, which then connects the\\r\\nprospective contributor to the team’s on-ramping process. To do this we created a web page that highlighted these different types of contributions and\\r\\nthen handed people off to different teams where a team member could continue the on-\\r\\nramping of that person.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"724e6a41-7b28-4d8e-a16a-948ab6dcd0eb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"724e6a41-7b28-4d8e-a16a-948ab6dcd0eb\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"EULmZVGt7VhpiXUSfzXCfLz0zo5BAamLBhj9XjPXsXc=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"FJa5oQjkjQZugAFhcU8BgIWuJmocyrGwKPAAYSvNqfs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3dd1a4d0-a765-48a6-9ecb-8b46242393e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"mpWTKFt+OWfhjbI1UwQ74ti7BHhWRFdCk08XjQjCF7s=\"}},\"hash\":\"1aPnHZPY7paXfkHk1iaJ87ke9KxVOF7sctDbIbT3fm0=\",\"text\":\"We found this worked pretty effectively, but the high-level web page\\r\\nneeded a lot of user testing, feedback, and changes to serve these needs well.

If we\\r\\nwant people to contribute to our community, they need to have the appropriate skills to be\\r\\nable to deliver good work. Skills acquisition involves two broad challenges:\\r\\n•How do we provide all the facilities required to help new community members learn what\\r\\nthey need to contribute? •   How do we help give them the confidence to participate? The former is the big, obvious challenge. Fortunately in the current age of the (mostly)\\r\\nubiquitous Internet, self-learning is common. Most Internet users have used various websites\\r\\nand facilities and learned how to do something, be it using web email, using a piece of\\r\\ntechnology, or something else. The Internet is awash with varying quality levels of help and\\r\\nguidance for almost anything, and people around the world are used to performing research\\r\\nand self-teaching. As such, we want to try to produce processes and resources for learning these\\r\\nskills in our communities. It is important to remember, though, that skills acquisition is not just about producing tutorials\\r\\nand documentation and putting them online. While this documentation does help, the pure\\r\\navailability of it does not necessarily mean people will read it. Also, when people read it they\\r\\nwill likely have questions, problems and issues with their learning, and other areas in which\\r\\nthey need help and guidance. As such, when building your solution here you want to strive\\r\\nto produce (a) core knowledge transfer material (e.g., documentation), (b) methods of\\r\\nencouraging the consumption of that material, and (c) support facilities to provide help and\\r\\nguidance. In the Ubuntu community we served these kinds of needs in a few different ways. First we\\r\\nencouraged the community to document help and guidance that could be useful to others. This included the creation of a knowledge base of content and an actively communicated ethos\\r\\nthat the knowledge base should be added to and extended when someone noticed that a key\\r\\npiece of information or guidance was missing.

In many cases new prospective community members feel a\\r\\nlittle nervous and self-conscious about whether they can contribute, often because they see so\\r\\nmany other smart and active contributors and feel unsure about whether they can match their\\r\\nabilities. You should make a point of breaking down this self-doubt and replacing it with confidence\\r\\nand support from the community to help grow confidence in contributing. Achieving this\\r\\nusually involves plenty of positive messaging, positive reenforcement, and one-on-one\\r\\nencouragement. Determining Contributions\\r\\nWhile in most communities the previous two steps on the on-ramp get plenty of focus, the\\r\\ndetermining contributions component often gets less attention. Part of the reason for this is that making people aware of the on-ramp and helping people to\\r\\nup-skill themselves is often a largely single-shot chunk of work that, when completed, we can\\r\\nforget about. The challenge of giving people something to work on requires more attention to\\r\\ndetail as the tasks that need to be completed at any given time change from day to day. The other challenge here is that different community members with different levels of\\r\\nexperience are better suited to different types of work.

To help disseminate these bite-size bugs I asked each member of my team to write weekly blog\\r\\nposts highlighting bugs that need to be resolved, and inviting prospective community members\\r\\nto take a look at these bugs. In each of these blog entries there would also be links to our up-\\r\\nskilling resources, support channels, and more. As such, these blog entries would provide a set\\r\\nof simple issues that need fixing, thank people who fixed the issues from the previous week\\r\\n(which grows the kudos part of the on-ramp), and also highlight a standard set of resources\\r\\nthat can be used to learn the skills to fix those issues. We found these weekly posts to be\\r\\nsuccessful in driving more participation in different teams. Growing Kudos\\r\\nWhen you get to this final component on the on-ramp, your community members have already\\r\\ncommitted extensively to your community; they have been inspired to participate, learned the\\r\\nskills they need, and contributed to a task that needed completing. In any typical case of one\\r\\nhuman being helping another with something, we say thanks; you should find ways to do the\\r\\nsame thing in your community. In small communities this is less of a problem: it is easy to see a contribution and thank the\\r\\nperson who performed it. In bigger communities this can be more challenging; when there are\\r\\nhundreds or thousands of things going on every week or month it is impractical to be able to\\r\\nsay thanks for everything. This is an important challenge to scale, though; validation is a key\\r\\npiece in helping to maintain a sense of belonging and appreciation for your community\\r\\nmembers.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4dd2a4c0-c89b-464a-a414-c900fca0c750":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4dd2a4c0-c89b-464a-a414-c900fca0c750\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"Zh1AI39eooSfEpS0zQODfRvuyCEIWUR2T2yIP4p9BBQ=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"hBtIsvIHmBXqQTBsnlDqLfwqtDhVKgbKTZm9WbC7dTY=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"32e8c731-58a6-4002-8c01-79a0af1ea9ad\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"JdKhLmw78qmQLWSaahw3IeAFottz4CP672nsw8+p/pU=\"}},\"hash\":\"XbwPPlNv8mSPixu19pbqlQuEBqvRKa6cPuK8a83059M=\",\"text\":\"I have traditionally focused on encouraging an appreciation culture in two core forms:\\r\\nBroadcast appreciation\\r\\nBroadcasting out to the wider community appreciation for work and accomplishments\\r\\nmade by particular teams or people\\r\\nContextual appreciation\\r\\nSaying thanks for work and accomplishments to the people who did them at a one-to-\\r\\none level\\r\\nPROCESSES: SIMPLE IS SUSTAINABLE   127\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0534eb7e-6b54-48e7-8f6b-ccdb3741da13":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0534eb7e-6b54-48e7-8f6b-ccdb3741da13\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"Wn+GZ0NZXtnO+NsMG9ws+5Asv/4kC3EsNUmAms3UT8c=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"JRCa2UdrsglSxiAP2ajRW0HrtcV6M5o/R1sTfzYdgb4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"51f53b0e-d257-4c75-969b-9f1404492527\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"N/OzVeB6/E5XgviO8K9MyP1x1pp0gqRiSIyQtR9ME9k=\"}},\"hash\":\"DBwCbHcOVsKsTnfi1iamK7X1/Hy2ijfNTD9DVqKebec=\",\"text\":\"Both of these approaches are important within collaborative communities. From the\\r\\nperspective of the community member being thanked, the broadcast approach is nice to see as\\r\\nyou feel a sense of appreciation disseminated across the wider community; the wider\\r\\ncommunity see that you did a great job. The contextual approach is nice to see to provide a\\r\\ngeneral sense of appreciation in your day-to-day activities; you do something and someone\\r\\nsays thanks and it makes the community feel positive and fun. For the broadcast appreciation approach you should encourage your community to write blog\\r\\nentries and articles that highlight great work and thank people. This is particularly important\\r\\nfor community leaders to do. Communities are social groupings and inspirational leaders\\r\\nthanking and highlighting great work is incredibly motivating. In Ubuntu we have tackled this approach by encouraging a culture of thankful blogging and I\\r\\nhave worked with our community leaders to encourage them to do this. In many cases this\\r\\nwould involve me reaching out to a leader and asking this person to blog. In most cases the\\r\\nleader was happy to do this and the recipient of the kudos felt great when seeing it. For the contextual appreciation approach this is more of a cultural norm that you want to build;\\r\\nyou want to grow a culture in which it is normal to say thanks when someone does something\\r\\nfor or contributes to the community. In Ubuntu we have approached this by regularly\\r\\nreminding people of and encouraging this behavior and highlighting the positivity it generates.

They are typically based on current conditions: the\\r\\ncurrent level of contribution, demand, expectations, and goals. They are the clear plastic film\\r\\nthat wraps around the assets and members of your community. As the assets and members\\r\\nadjust, so should the processes. At the start of this chapter, we firmly established that unchanging processes cause bureaucracy. Processes that no longer map effectively to the people who need to use them cause\\r\\nbureaucracy. Our whirlwind tour of process best practices would not be complete if we didn’t\\r\\ndiscuss how we can best evaluate our processes and make changes where appropriate, thus\\r\\navoiding the dreaded claw of bureaucracy. Process reassessment has become a staple part of each Ubuntu release. The Ubuntu community\\r\\nhas a huge range of processes, initiatives, governance structures, and more. Each of these\\r\\nfacilities was developed to serve a specific purpose, but as the community has grown and\\r\\nchanged, these purposes and processes have needed to change, too. An example of this was a change in how Ubuntu members have traditionally been approved. Anyone can be a member under the premise that he has demonstrated a significant and\\r\\nsustained contribution to open source. Traditionally, the way this assessment was made was\\r\\nthat the candidate would first produce a wiki page outlining these contributions. The next step\\r\\nwould be to attend a Community Council meeting online in which the council would discuss\\r\\nthe application and vote. A majority vote would approve the member. As the Ubuntu community continued to grow, this process became increasingly overstretched. The vast majority of Community Council meetings were devoted to approving members, and\\r\\nmeetings were dragging on for nearly three hours. At an Ubuntu Developer Summit we\\r\\nidentified the problem and proposed that we set up a series of regional subcouncils. We planned\\r\\nto set up a council in the Americas, Europe, and Australasia, and these would take over the\\r\\ntask of approving members. The new councils were formed, and subsequent membership applications have been uniformly\\r\\nmore efficient. This not only has benefited prospective members, but also has meant that\\r\\nCommunity Council meetings have been more focused on governance issues than merely\\r\\napproving members. These kinds of process reviews used to occur on an ad hoc basis in the Ubuntu world, but we\\r\\nhave since tied them to a regular timeline.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0f74fb95-c2dd-4bbf-ac50-7aac2e2930c3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0f74fb95-c2dd-4bbf-ac50-7aac2e2930c3\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"U+OdfFgTDD3I/LFcwD5qiPaXRM4xFQYlHKM7/xCAAyI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"+6uQptWJ7pDLzw1UG38FtFKiiTuWtIxzDjo5pN8P3Jk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"f6744794-81b7-4a58-a644-5ac93732f2e8\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wRttZCe12lcjXIT4U9fO1FzGZqORH21IDXgqyYZcbHA=\"}},\"hash\":\"4q7cH2UZZrFlU0kLHWJtxZxnR3IHYvvPssuo3OWQDVA=\",\"text\":\"We now reassess all processes at the beginning of\\r\\na cycle, and many of these reassessments occur at our biannual Ubuntu Developer Summit.

Building Regularity\\r\\nWith your community, you should schedule regular process reassessments. You should\\r\\nschedule a time in which your community can come together to determine how to improve\\r\\non these underlying structures and processes. How you do this is really dependent on your community. For a small local community, why\\r\\nnot organize a series of meetings in a coffee shop or at someone’s house? For an online\\r\\ncommunity, a series of scheduled sessions on an online chat network such as IRC is often\\r\\neffective. Alternatively, you could organize a more formalized event for your community, akin\\r\\nto what we do with our Ubuntu Developer Summit. However you choose to organize this reassessment, you should ensure the following:\\r\\n•   The events should be accessible to your community members. They should preferably\\r\\nincur as little cost as possible, and be within reasonable reach. Organizing a reassessment\\r\\nin Jamaica when your community is based in Northern England is not practical. •The events should be open to all of your community members, and you should explicitly\\r\\nstate this when promoting them. You should clearly communicate that everyone is\\r\\nwelcome to join in and provide feedback about how to improve how the community runs. •   Ensure a sensible level of representation. Feedback sessions with 2 or 200 people are not\\r\\nvaluable. Sessions with 10–30 people offer real opportunity to achieve some conclusions. •   Ensure that you begin organizing these sessions with plenty of notice, particularly for\\r\\nphysical meetings. When advertising these sessions, you should make them as attractive and practical as possible\\r\\nfor your members. Don’t describe the session as a “governance and process review,” but rather\\r\\nas “how to improve our community. ” Make sure your announcement welcomes everyone,\\r\\nand ensure that it underlines how everyone can have an impact.

In many of these sessions there is a potential for the discussion\\r\\nto wander off on a tangent. It is therefore important to have a firm idea of what to discuss and\\r\\nwhat the core issues are. I recommend following these steps to carve out a method of handling these sessions:\\r\\n1. Make a list of all the processes that are involved in your community. This should cover\\r\\ntopics such as how people get involved, how you work together, how teams work, and so\\r\\non. I recommend you do this in an online document, such as a wiki page. 2.For each process, include bullet points outlining the feedback you have heard, both good\\r\\nand bad. 3. Look at the full list and reorganize it into what you consider priority order. This is most\\r\\ntypically driven by which processes are causing bottlenecks and problems in your\\r\\ncommunity. 4. Inform the wider community of the list and ask people to either edit the list directly (if\\r\\nthey can, such as with a wiki) or submit feedback for you to add to the list. You should\\r\\nask for feedback about the processes and which processes they consider the most important\\r\\nto discuss. Give them a deadline for feedback that is before the reassessment sessions. Merge this feedback into the document and reprioritize the list based on the consensus. This list is your agenda for the meetings. When you get together with the community, pick the\\r\\ntop processes and discuss them in turn. Communicate the good and bad feedback with the\\r\\ncommunity, and focus the discussion on coming up with modifications to the processes that\\r\\nmay be an improvement. Always keep these discussions focused on achieving outcomes; they\\r\\ncan quickly degenerate into fruitless conversations. When you reach consensus on changes to these processes, you should ensure that the changes\\r\\nare noted down in the session. These notes provide a TODO list of changes to your process\\r\\ndocumentation. Remember that each time a process changes, you should announce it to the\\r\\nwider community, just as you did with new processes.

For each minute of Internet\\r\\naccess, I would put the requisite 10 pence in a cardboard box next to the computer. At the end\\r\\nof the month when the phone bill came in, the money in the box could cover my usage. Simple. Well, at the end of the month a bill for £190 arrived, and there was six quid in the box. The\\r\\nphilosophy of “it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission” didn’t wash with my parents. Over in the US, things were different. Many parts of the country had flat-rate local access and\\r\\nestablished Internet access at universities. The growth of these cheap networks made it easy\\r\\nfor online communities to form. Early on, these communities shared knowledge as text files,\\r\\npacked with ideas, techniques, and recipes to make things.

A successful workflow requires understanding what you want\\r\\nto achieve and making the steps in which you achieve it as simple as possible for as many\\r\\npeople as possible. One of the reasons why the Firefox browser has been so popular has been its extensibility. A large and growing collection of Firefox add-ons is available. These small bundles of\\r\\nfunctionality, basically small pieces of software, integrate tightly into the browser and can do\\r\\nanything from block ads to allow web developers to dynamically adjust the layout of web pages. Traditionally, installing software has been possible using a variety of approaches: installers,\\r\\npackage archives, compiling code, and more. The Firefox team made it as simple as selecting\\r\\nan add-on and clicking Install. Firefox takes care of the rest. Workflow and usability are close\\r\\ncompanions. Another successful workflow example comes from Bytemark Hosting. This small company\\r\\nprovides virtual hosting machines that run Linux. If my machine was unresponsive for some\\r\\nreason, it offered a command-line-driven administration console that I could log in to. That\\r\\nconsole let me restart the machine and gather diagnostic information. Although it might have\\r\\nseemed complex and technical to the average Firefox user, the console was fast, efficient, and\\r\\nintuitive for most Linux users. If a machine was down, I could be into the console within\\r\\nminutes and have it back up again, all from my familiar command-line interface. The connection between both of these examples is the first task in understanding workflow:\\r\\nknow your audience. Roles\\r\\nPeople always have expectations.

Identify the parallels between the multiple people who perform the same type of task (such as\\r\\nprogramming), and you begin to build a mental picture of their expectations and experience. Your own experience will also guide how you build strong community and identify with these\\r\\ndifferent roles. Repeated experiences in particular can be critical for understanding what is\\r\\ngoing on. I had a colleague who made sales to big companies. On his first big deal, he went through an\\r\\nintense set of emotions. He first built confidence while the client was excited about the product. As the negotiations moved forward, he was cautious but confident. All was going well until he\\r\\nhit a roadblock in the negotiations.

We wanted to take a snapshot of the application for members of our community to\\r\\ntest and tell us when things went wrong. This would give us an opportunity to fix remaining\\r\\nbugs. That helps us produce the first item in our workflow specification, the objective that you\\r\\nwant to achieve:\\r\\nOBJECTIVE: To have more users install and test a development snapshot of Jokosher and\\r\\nprovide feedback on bugs. The next step is to identify the audience. We did not want developers to test Jokosher; we\\r\\nwanted real users to test it. We wanted people to use Jokosher for real music production and\\r\\nmake assumptions based on real use cases. THE RISKS OF AUTOPILOT\\r\\nA common problem that can occur when observing how people use software is when the user\\r\\nknows of a particular quirk in a product and works to naturally avoid triggering the quirk. This is\\r\\ncommon with software developers, and before release, the software typically is not used in the same\\r\\nmanner as it is by normal users after release. A good antidote to this problem is to simply put new users in front of the software who are entirely\\r\\nunaware of the quirks and oddities. They can often present the most valuable feedback. Let’s now add our audience to our spec:\\r\\nAUDIENCE: Musicians or audiophiles who have basic computer knowledge. The next step is in describing the primary pieces in the workflow. At this point we’re just\\r\\nidentifying the major steps; we’ll add the details later. Add these as a series of OUTCOME items. For example:\\r\\nOUTCOME: Install a current snapshot of Jokosher and all required dependencies. OUTCOME: Use and test primary features in Jokosher. OUTCOME: Provide feedback about bugs.

The ideal scenario was that someone could simply download a file and Jokosher would run:\\r\\nthis matched our audience profile. It would be simple, easy, and efficient, perfect for our users. Stuart Langridge produced a script that downloaded the Jokosher code, installed the relevant\\r\\ndependencies on the user’s system, and ran Jokosher with a click of the mouse. The script\\r\\nchecked to see whether the dependencies were already installed, and skipped their installation\\r\\nif they were. The user could use the same script for the first run and subsequent runs, and not\\r\\neven think about the concept of installation. Simple. In the workflow spec, you should document each step from the perspective of your AUDIENCE. For the Jokosher installation example:\\r\\nOUTCOME: Install a current snapshot of Jokosher and all required dependencies. Download a script from jokosher.org. Make the script executable (explained with documentation). Double-click the icon to run the script and install Jokosher. To rerun, double-click the icon again.

When you understand the driving forces behind how\\r\\nconversations occur, you can make some really interesting things happen. Awhile back my team spent some time working on optimizing the conversation around bugs. Before I explain the solution, let’s take the problem for a spin. In the open source world, bugs are a complex topic, and they are particularly complicated for\\r\\nLinux distributions. Consider the problem. Erica is using Ubuntu and experiences a problem\\r\\nin the text editor: when she tries to spellcheck, the editor crashes. As an experienced open source citizen, she is familiar with the mantra that when something\\r\\ngoes wrong, you should report it. She clicks the Help menu in the text editor and clicks on\\r\\n“Report a problem... ” to report the bug. At this point she now expects someone in Ubuntu to\\r\\ntend to the bug report and hopefully fix it. So far, so good. Now it gets a little more complicated. The text editor in Ubuntu is actually called GEdit. It is\\r\\nan open source project that is part of the GNOME desktop. The GNOME project is an\\r\\nindependent project that produces software, and the open source parlance for this kind of\\r\\nproject refers to it as an upstream project. Ubuntu developers take the upstream GNOME source code (including GEdit) and build\\r\\npackages to ship it in Ubuntu. When this code is built, some modifications are made to make\\r\\nGNOME (and as such, GEdit) integrate well in Ubuntu. This includes consistent themes, file\\r\\ndialog boxes, folder locations, and more. In a nutshell, Ubuntu takes the original upstream\\r\\nsource code, adds some changes, builds it, and ships the final product as part of Ubuntu. This raises our first question: who is responsible for the bug? Was the bug present in the original\\r\\nupstream code from GNOME? Was it in the changes made by Ubuntu developers?

Does the bug even exist at all?\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2d452cee-c70f-4347-b0e1-640247f0730a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2d452cee-c70f-4347-b0e1-640247f0730a\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"BD8R0PWuuOe+vbpJFVWKbUkalzvEo0hmtiEM358MOVA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Of6TGYy3oyU6Tdf8TEUNacygGlQL5bWHsraM93miMj0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6fd9691c-7b39-4df8-8bad-cd3351c61c39\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"rfC8BinzfPQ15EkzVlqxHkhxPQ709FN/beD2dbQAl0I=\"}},\"hash\":\"fiHUq4j/sOBV79s1Rd3ODphOXSuXReU6ka6k2SkC8No=\",\"text\":\"Does the\\r\\nbug exist outside GNOME and GEdit?

The second question is the one that is pertinent to our bug conversation. How do we deal with\\r\\nthe bug report? Erica rightly reported the bug, but should she report it in the Ubuntu bug\\r\\ntracker (called Launchpad) or the GNOME bug tracker? In addition to this, many other people\\r\\nmay have experienced the bug. Some will report it in their distribution’s bug tracker and some\\r\\nwill report it in the upstream bug tracker. It is not entirely inconceivable that there is a bug\\r\\nreport in each distribution’s bug tracker and one in the upstream bug tracker all pointing to\\r\\nthe same bug. This is hugely wasteful. Regardless of all this duplication of effort, if the bug exists upstream and the distribution ships\\r\\nit, the bug does still exist in the distribution and it does exist upstream.

The solution to this problem is to identify how the flow of conversation\\r\\nand collaboration happens between these different bug reports and to optimize it. Fortunately, software can address these issues. Launchpad, the web service that Ubuntu uses\\r\\nas a bug tracker, already had the ability to link bugs, whether they’re in the same tracker or a\\r\\ndifferent one. When Erica filed her bug, she or someone else could connect her bug to an\\r\\nexisting bug in an upstream bug tracker. It works like this:\\r\\n1. If the developer knows the bug is an upstream bug but does not know which bug it is in\\r\\nthe upstream bug tracker, he can add an upstream task to the bug report. This upstream\\r\\ntask indicates that the bug should be linked to an upstream bug when it is found. 2.If the developer knows the bug in the upstream bug tracker matches the Ubuntu bug, he\\r\\ncan link the two bugs. This involves finding the Ubuntu bug and using the Link feature in\\r\\nLaunchpad to enter the URL of the upstream bug. When a bug is linked, any changes made to the upstream bug are synchronized in Launchpad\\r\\nand vice versa. This feature connects the two separate conversations. Getting to know the problem\\r\\nAlthough this is a hugely useful and valuable feature, we got the impression that not enough\\r\\nbugs were getting linked. The problem I wanted my team to solve was to explore why these\\r\\nbugs were not being linked, and to help increase the linkages. Although we had a hunch that not that many people were linking bugs, we really had no idea. We had no concrete statistics to back up our assumptions. Our first task was to learn more\\r\\nabout the problem. To do this we produced a tool called the Ubuntu Upstream Report. The report mined the\\r\\nLaunchpad bug tracker to show the top 100 upstreams shipped in Ubuntu ordered by the\\r\\ngreatest number of open bugs. We knew that these 100 upstreams were likely to be the largest\\r\\nand most significant projects: more bugs in the open source world typically means larger\\r\\nprojects with more users using the software and therefore filing more bugs. For each upstream in the report, we showed which bugs were open, which had been triaged\\r\\nto determine they were actually bugs, which were known to be upstream bugs (marked as\\r\\nupstream tasks), and which had linkages associated with those tasks.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d53affbc-ce81-4acf-ac8a-01721528a207":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d53affbc-ce81-4acf-ac8a-01721528a207\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"4qEa5/BoEhUpSUYDlphGH3SVOXqmcJAPofjU+BoG4S4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"nxXlGpeImaijZuKAQ9IvK8VEBFyVqCjsq1SluO2d1as=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"a2c157e8-28a2-4ef6-853f-b60c74660810\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Aa7337KpseZ/vbgvE6/YqMeWQe8g5XNgi0dSumujXXk=\"}},\"hash\":\"j/XsMAFp9ubBZFhc0YWtGyvJ0L22s6Exq2VNc1Xoy9U=\",\"text\":\"The differences between the numbers generated interesting conclusions.

Breaking down the conversation\\r\\nThe raw data in the upstream report was the foundation of not only exploring the problem,\\r\\nbut also solving it. The data confirmed our suspicion that a lot of bugs weren’t being linked. On a practical level, it helped us to understand which upstreams needed help, and therefore\\r\\nwhich contributors to speak to. To raise the number of linked bugs, we needed to identify the three key aspects of the bug-\\r\\nhandling process (reporting, triage, and linking) and improve them. Our first area to focus on\\r\\nwas linking, as it was the most immediate goal. We examined and optimized each step in the\\r\\nprocess of linking a bug. We discovered, for example, that finding bugs in the upstream bug\\r\\ntracker took the most time, so we explored methods of syncing bug data across the Launchpad\\r\\nand upstream bug reports automatically, automating duplication searches, and simplifying the\\r\\nuser interface for the whole shebang. Our next step was to optimize the reporting and triage process. This was an area in which we\\r\\nhad already poured extensive work, and our workflow here was generally pretty good. Where\\r\\nthere appeared to be a disconnect, though, was with documentation and people reading and\\r\\nmaking use of that documented best practice. Although there was plenty of documentation, it\\r\\nwas scattered all over the Ubuntu wiki, difficult to navigate, and complex to read. We\\r\\nreorganized and improved it, dividing it into better sections and making it easier to understand. We organized documentation days; encouraged community participation; celebrated the\\r\\nimprovements; and encouraged our bug triagers to review, expand, and make use of the new\\r\\ndocumentation that was produced.

Collaborative online projects need a diverse set of supporting tools to flourish. Even the\\r\\nsimplest community will use tools for communicating, storing work, and sharing information.

It could arguably involve\\r\\nadditional tools, such as those required to produce the fix and generate the patch. There are\\r\\nmany areas in which the tools could be integrated:\\r\\n•   The bug tracker and source control system could use the same login credentials. •The bug tracker could display recent branches in the source control system that refer to a\\r\\nspecific bug number in the changelog. •   When a patch is attached to a bug report or a bug status changes, that could generate an\\r\\nautomatic email to the project mailing list to inform the community that a fix has been\\r\\nmade available. •When a fix is sent to the mailing list with a bug number, additional information from the\\r\\nbug tracker could be automatically added to the message.

The problem looks a little like this:\\r\\n1.A new community is born around a goal. This goal could be to produce software, change\\r\\nthe political landscape, or anything else. 2. The founders of the community set up the communication channels, and some early\\r\\nmembers join. 3. Additional tools are required. This could involve a website, blogging tools, technical\\r\\ndevelopment facilities, or anything else. 4. Using a website as an example, a discussion kicks off asking which content management\\r\\nsystem should be used. A long and drawn-out debate starts over which system to use. These debates can drag on for a long time. I have seen this same scenario happen over and over again. There is nothing wrong with\\r\\nwanting to choose the best tools for your community, but you need to get your priorities\\r\\nstraight. When you set up a new community, one priority is more important than all others: building a\\r\\nteam. Your #1 goal is to get people involved. You need to get people inspired to join your\\r\\ncrusade. If you don’t attract people and get them up and running and productive as soon as\\r\\npossible, your community will feel like it is treading water. Debates over which tool to use should be kept as short and sweet as possible. You should seek\\r\\nto establish requirements and gain consensus around a chosen tool as quickly as you can. Always remember that these discussions will garner strong opinions for different tools. You\\r\\nwill never make everyone happy, so you need to identify the requirements and pick something\\r\\nas soon as viably possible. The sooner you get your tools up and running and get people focused\\r\\non doing useful work, the better.

Instead, the following pages will advise you of some key considerations\\r\\nthat you should keep in mind when evaluating which tools you want to use to solve a particular\\r\\nproblem. When evaluating specific software solutions, you should meld the advice here with your\\r\\ncurrent requirements. You should also factor in predicted requirements for the next three\\r\\nyears. If you can find a solution that will keep your project productive for three years, you\\r\\nhave hit the jackpot. Our goal here is to keep migration to new systems to a minimum:\\r\\nmigration is disruptive, complex, and time-consuming. Bug Tracking\\r\\nBug tracking is a critical part of any software project, particularly open source projects. It is one\\r\\nof the core mechanics of how your project works. It should be a central part of your\\r\\ndevelopment process and a daily component for each of your developers. A range of bug-tracking solutions are available, from those your project hosts (such as Bugzilla)\\r\\nto third-party-hosted systems (such as Launchpad). Bug trackers vary hugely in terms of\\r\\nfeatures. Some are simple, designed for small projects with a small number of developers. Some\\r\\nare hugely complex, infinitely customizable behemoths of functionality. Before you choose a bug tracker, you should evaluate your requirements. Do you need a simple\\r\\nbug tracker to merely maintain a list of defects in your software, or do you need a complex\\r\\nsolution with custom fields, multiple projects, teams, automation, and other features? A common temptation for new open source projects is to install the most feature-packed bug\\r\\ntracker available. The reasoning behind this is usually “just in case we need those features. ”\\r\\nWhatever your needs, always keep usability as a key requirement in picking a bug tracker. If\\r\\nyou use a solution that is too complex, it will annoy potential bug reporters and most certainly\\r\\nannoy those performing triage. TRANSPARENCY IN BUG TRACKING\\r\\nYou should ensure that your project’s bug tracker is publicly available and that anyone and\\r\\neveryone can access it. As such, you should not restrict viewing the bug tracker to username and\\r\\npassword access. There are many reasons for this:\\r\\n• There is no need to restrict bug information if it affects a collaborative community project. •Users who are experiencing problems can search quickly and easily for information that might\\r\\nhelp them fix the problem. 148   CHAPTER FIVE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7c6dae90-8253-4fbc-a34b-c4728ee662ee":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7c6dae90-8253-4fbc-a34b-c4728ee662ee\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"uAkattXaE3v+0U1zaowSR8Y4E0yimFOuXxK30yTDhrE=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"fbpUBe3EMy84vZ54aCYTZy01YtJeoU/ElWCwnQSY7eg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"803d3b9b-88d9-487e-8d55-b93b629e4af0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"/3qzjFwpz6x1FmJwzWYXj5LPum2m2krBB4IElraomno=\"}},\"hash\":\"ZnGtWD3eZ6J8UPmySVgt6GCAT4RdcMSif8E8bpcpaIY=\",\"text\":\"• Eric Raymond, a well-known open source proponent, once uttered, “Given enough eyeballs,\\r\\nall bugs are shallow. ” Open bug tracking provides an excellent opportunity for community\\r\\nmembers who are blighted by the same bug to explore, share notes, and possibly even fix the\\r\\nbug together. The only time I consider a closed bug tracker or private bug reports to be suitable for community\\r\\nprojects is when Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) work for a specific vendor is occurring, but in a\\r\\nmanner that does not compromise the wider project. Bugs that affect the wider project should never\\r\\nbe private. Bug reporting\\r\\nYou should make every effort to make bug reporting as easy as possible. Some projects (such\\r\\nas Ubuntu) embed a link into an application that simplifies this process. Ubuntu also uses a\\r\\nspecial tool called Apport to bundle up debugging information to send to the bug tracker\\r\\nautomatically when something crashes. This is a useful feature, as traditionally many\\r\\ndevelopers doing triage would ask bug reporters to enter a series of commands that gather\\r\\ndebugging information and add it to the report. Apport (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport)\\r\\nautomates this process. Other projects make the act of reporting the bug on the bug tracker as easy as possible. An\\r\\nexample of this is Jokosher, which only asks for a Subject and Description of the bug, leaving\\r\\nit up to the Jokosher triage team to manage the rest of the information. It is important to\\r\\nremember that your bug reporters are unlikely to know most of the requirements for a bug\\r\\nreport. Another project that has taken an interesting approach is GNOME. GNOME produced a\\r\\nsimplified frontend to its Bugzilla bug tracker, and the tracker asks only a few simple questions. It is recommended that you keep your own bug reporting frontend as simple as possible. Bug triage\\r\\nFor each bug that comes into your bug tracker, various decisions need to be made. This includes\\r\\nconfirming whether it is actually a bug, asking for additional information from the reporter,\\r\\nassigning the bug to people or teams, and classifying the urgency of the bug. Triage is a process that your developers will typically need to engage in, and few developers\\r\\nwant to spend any more time on it than is absolutely necessary.

The DVCS makes it easier than ever for new contributors to produce features\\r\\nand fixes that can be merged into the main branch. I don’t want to get into a debate about which version control system to use; other resources\\r\\ncan provide a far better assessment of that. One piece of advice I do offer, however, is that you\\r\\nshould strongly consider some of the integrated tools that exist around these systems. As an\\r\\nexample, the Launchpad system integrates tightly with the Bazaar DVCS and makes tasks such\\r\\nas reviewing merges and viewing changes a point-and-click affair. These kinds of features can\\r\\nbe hugely useful with such an important component in the software development toolchain. Collaborative Editing\\r\\nBack in the early days of open source, we all lied to the world about documentation. “Want to\\r\\nget involved in open source but can’t write code? Sure you can help! Write documentation! ”\\r\\nBack then, if you wanted to write documentation you needed to install a complex menagerie\\r\\nof text processing tools, write your documentation in a markup language, ensure that the\\r\\ndocument properly validated, and then convert the documentation into something the user\\r\\ncould read. In a nutshell, it was way too complex. Most people who write documentation for open source software projects would fall into the\\r\\ncategory of “power user. ” They are technology enthusiasts who are not interested in the super-\\r\\ntechnical avenues of programming, but want to help out. Many of these people have good\\r\\nwriting skills and a good knowledge of using the software, so the documentation fit is natural. With Jokosher we wanted to acknowledge this profile of user. As such, instead of focusing on\\r\\ncomplex text processing tools, we encouraged our documentation contributors to use a wiki. Those who did not know the wiki markup would use the graphical wiki editor. We got some\\r\\ngreat contributions because we identified the workflow with the type of contributor. Building and Maintaining Transparency\\r\\nTransparency is a key theme not only throughout this book, but also throughout community\\r\\nbuilding in general. Openness is an important ingredient in healthy communities, and your\\r\\ncommunity needs to feel that there is transparency throughout its governance, processes,\\r\\ncommunication, and workflow.

Each of these areas is important for a healthy community. Let’s now spend some time looking\\r\\ninto them, and cover some of the key points in keeping your community open and accessible. TRANSPARENCY FOR NEW CONTRIBUTORS\\r\\nAn important area in terms of transparency is how people who are not yet trusted contributors can\\r\\ncontribute to the project to gain trust. This is covered in Chapter 4. Tool Access\\r\\nYou should always ensure that the tools you choose to use for your community are easy to\\r\\naccess, well documented, and freely available. This has historically been an important factor for most open source projects. If you look at the\\r\\nmajority of open source projects, the tools and dependencies they use are also entirely free and\\r\\nopen source. An example of this is the GNOME desktop environment. Not only is GNOME free\\r\\nand open, but the tools used to build it also are free and open. This includes the toolkit (Gtk),\\r\\nC compiler (gcc), debugger (gdb), GUI designer (glade), and more. Although most open source projects use free tools, many projects do use proprietary tools. Some years back I spoke at a Microsoft DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper! Day in the United\\r\\nKingdom. As an open source guy, I was expecting to be greeted with a healthy dose of\\r\\nsuspicion. Not only was everyone incredibly welcoming, but there also was a surprisingly\\r\\nstrong sense of community. There were a number of user groups and communities based\\r\\naround Microsoft technology, and in addition to this, many Microsoft fans released open source\\r\\nsoftware, but they used proprietary Microsoft products to produce the code. Although this is fine, I recommend using freely available tools. Contributing to a community\\r\\nwhere you can download the tool immediately for free is far easier than having to spend $300\\r\\non a tool before you can participate. When you have decided on your toolchain, you should ensure that it is well documented on\\r\\nyour community’s website. You should specify:\\r\\n•   The tools that are used in your project\\r\\n•   Where you can obtain the tools required\\r\\n•Instructions for how to use these tools to obtain the work your community produces (such\\r\\nas the source code for an application) and how to run it\\r\\n152   CHAPTER FIVE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2b6303de-04c4-4102-bcbe-64de475f1dbc":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2b6303de-04c4-4102-bcbe-64de475f1dbc\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"DefQQvTSrRX2A4U3hZr74i8eRWoWCpBJQuABqgVSK9w=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"I6uLqjSBLFJ0VEbnQd3/7BhwI2nyX1FCRAfjKcfs76Q=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"28fd6f61-b5b1-4eee-a5f4-09484dc46966\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"4a5284DI/eqb9LWnefV9jjnFJdAfxWB4dtNszaZ6bWg=\"}},\"hash\":\"oKfqir2Lu0Poo4S0PeyzLH8auIdunCiFyEntR+6Vkxw=\",\"text\":\"Another useful goal to aim for, particularly with regard to software development, is to ensure\\r\\nthat each contribution is documented. Ideally, you want any contributor to be able to point to\\r\\nany of her contributions by referencing a URL on the Internet. If every contribution can be\\r\\nreferenced, your community will be transparent by definition. An example of this is how many open source projects have mailing lists that get posted to\\r\\nautomatically with each new commit to the source control system. This simple solution ensures\\r\\nthat anyone can subscribe to a list of source code updates. One alternative to a mailing list is\\r\\nan RSS feed of updates. Communications\\r\\nOpenness in communication is essential. Your communication channels are the very lifeblood\\r\\nof how ideas, problems, and solutions flow between the different members of your community. The golden rule here is to ensure that anyone (including those who are not currently part of\\r\\nyour community) can reference every communication online after it has occurred. I would\\r\\nlike to be able to go to any community and read conversations that I was not a part of so that\\r\\nI can evaluate the decisions that were made. This is happening today in most open source projects. Most projects have open mailing lists,\\r\\nand these lists have publicly visible archives that are automatically made available on the Web. Many communities also have small programs called bots that log IRC conversations and make\\r\\nthe discussions available on the Web. I would highly recommend making these kinds of archives and logs available. In many cases,\\r\\ndoing so is as simple as switching on a configuration option. The only time I consider it\\r\\nreasonable to have private archives is when a communication channel is being run by a\\r\\nCommunity Council. For many communities, sensitive and private discussions, particularly\\r\\nthose around conflict, are taken to the council. There are also conversations that pertain to an\\r\\nindividual, such as if a contributor has had some complaints made about him.

This would be a summary of decisions made at\\r\\nthe UDS that would affect the development of the next version of Ubuntu. Our first shot at this was to produce a wiki page for each track at the UDS and ask attendees\\r\\nto update the page at the end of each session. It was a simple process, but it got limited uptake. There simply was not time at the end of the sessions for people to summarize the agreements. As such, we got relatively sparse proceedings for each track. For the next UDS, we had a different idea. In recent years microblogging platforms such as\\r\\nTwitter and identi.ca had become a common part of many people’s workflow. It was not\\r\\nuncommon to send out a quick “tweet” or “dent” to let the world know what you are doing. We figured this could be an interesting approach for our proceedings at the UDS. To do this, we conducted an interesting experiment that worked rather well. Using identi.ca\\r\\nwe registered an account for each track at the UDS. In each track room we had the login details\\r\\nfor the account on the whiteboard. We would then encourage everyone to microblog as the\\r\\nsessions continued. The final part of the process was to write a script that took each microblog\\r\\nentry and divided the messages into the relevant sessions. As an example, all the messages on\\r\\nthe community track between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. would be automatically grouped under the\\r\\nheading “Making LoCo Teams Rock,” the name of the session at that time on the community\\r\\ntrack. The moral of this story is that to get effective reports, the method needs to be as low-friction\\r\\nas possible. People were already used to microblogging, so asking people to microblog sessions\\r\\nwas entirely natural for many people. This is the essence of effective reporting.

We used the issue tracker for a variety of purposes,\\r\\nand it was simple and effective. As the project grew, we were building up to shipping a major release. The project had more\\r\\nthan doubled in size, and there was a significant chunk of functionality built into the\\r\\napplication.

Philosophical hand waving and tool\\r\\nobsession will not grow you a productive, fun, and empowered community; day-to-day\\r\\napplication of these tools and an understanding of what lights our social fires will.

(The size\\r\\nlimit comes about because Twitter was designed to be convenient for users of SMS text\\r\\nmessaging, which had an arbitrary size limit by design. ) The site allows you to follow\\r\\npeople, see their messages, and even republish the messages. The concept may seem\\r\\nstrange to those of you who have never used Twitter, but it has become an invaluable tool\\r\\nfor connecting to people and keeping up-to-date with what they are doing and their\\r\\ninterests. Facebook\\r\\nAnother runaway success story, Facebook offers a place for people to provide updates on\\r\\nwhat they are doing, post pictures, share their interests, and keep up-to-date with what\\r\\nis going on in their friends’ lives. Facebook also provides tools for organizing events,\\r\\ncreating campaigns, and more. Google+\\r\\nWhile still very new at the time of this writing, Google+ is gaining momentum and\\r\\nprovides many similar features to Facebook but in an arguably nicer and more refined\\r\\nway—the same great social networking taste, just in a Google can. The major difference seems\\r\\nto be that Google+ is designed for sharing among a plethora of selected groups (“circles”)\\r\\nwhereas Facebook is still more commonly used for sharing one’s life with the world. 162   CHAPTER SIX\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"e260e6a6-921a-4232-a390-174f719e809d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"e260e6a6-921a-4232-a390-174f719e809d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cymUZveB331qFiiKMzV3z8Ti0lniw+KOKcKSZFqBMVU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"iUsbr8+YXMfrcKUdNym9V20yPREK4DM3Y5PCztOYgTg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9443d2e8-a563-4163-8d58-9075abb2d128\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"8ER55IGrmkw1sO/9BHwpQxEkJO5qqKeOvXwtQV9uvM0=\"}},\"hash\":\"XJBITy26f3gmWer9tVUzvqLm6otXZcZhEXXZtnibnZw=\",\"text\":\"Each of these tools can help us with three primary functions that we commonly have in our\\r\\ncommunities.

Here we will take a look at some of the most recognizable\\r\\nsocial networks. Twitter\\r\\nBack in 2006, a little-known podcasting company, Odeo, had a daylong meeting with its board\\r\\nmembers. Jack Dorsey, one of the members, presented an interesting idea he had been working\\r\\non: a text message–oriented service for sharing messages between groups. Originally called\\r\\ntwttr, following the trend of picking a word and removing vowels (which I bet frustrates the\\r\\nDutch), this is the service through which Dorsey published the first of what would later be\\r\\nknown as a tweet in March 2006. Shortly after the first prototype was working, the service was launched publicly.

In June 2010, around 65 million tweets were being\\r\\nsent each day. To a cynic, that is a lot of pints of milk being talked about. Like many technologies, Twitter started out life as a technical curiosity with those who were\\r\\ntechnically savvy enough to discover such curiosities, but has since become a global\\r\\nphenomenon. Celebrities, politicians, business leaders, community members, and many\\r\\ncompanies are using Twitter as a primary method of communicating with people. It is not a\\r\\nfad, either; these folks wouldn’t use it unless they saw real value in it. With the so-called Web 2.0 revolution (when the Web became more interactive and dynamic)\\r\\nmany start-ups and products tried to become ubiquitous, but Twitter didn’t only succeed at\\r\\nbringing a technology to the masses, it created an entirely new medium that is a common part\\r\\nof how many of us communicate online. You don’t often see whole new mediums of\\r\\ncommunication being taken on by everyone and his dog. As such, Twitter is a service you should definitely be using in your community, even if you are\\r\\nthe least technical, most online-adverse group. Twitter is a tremendous fishing net for you to\\r\\nattract community members, as well as communicating to others things that are going on in\\r\\nyour world. WHY TWITTER IS INTERESTING\\r\\nTwitter is interesting for a few reasons. First, it has become a truly ubiquitous means of\\r\\ncommunicating with others. Its sheer popularity has become a common reason to use the service,\\r\\nparticularly if you want to raise the awareness of your community and get other people involved. Twitter is also a wonderful medium for encouraging the viral dissemination of information; that is,\\r\\nbroadcasting news about your community and encouraging it to be shared again and again as the\\r\\naudience grows. This is largely due to the ease of sharing tweets by retweeting (Twitter users sharing\\r\\ntheir messages with their own followers) and the ease and low friction involved in following a user\\r\\non Twitter.

Zuckerberg\\r\\nthen started thinking a lot about how social experiences could work with technology, and\\r\\ncreated a first cut of these ideas called thefacebook.com. While thefacebook.com was initially limited to Harvard students, it soon expanded to MIT,\\r\\nColumbia, Boston University, New York University, Stanford, and Yale.

This makes Facebook a lot more social\\r\\nand interesting than some of the other social networking offerings. With your Facebook Profile all set you can now find and add friends. When you add friends\\r\\nyou can see their updates and activity on your Facebook Home, which is a rolling list of updates. Let’s say, for example, that your old schoolfriend Adam Hoffert is on Facebook. You can search\\r\\nfor him using the Search box, and when you find him you can add him as a friend. If he accepts\\r\\nyour friend request he will see updates from your Facebook Home and vice versa. You can\\r\\nthen look at his friend list and see if it contains people you know, and then invite them to be\\r\\nfriends with you; this is a great way to keep in touch with folks. While most Facebook users primarily just set up and use their own profile to share updates\\r\\nand interact with their friends, Facebook does have some other useful features:\\r\\nEvents\\r\\nAlerting people and inviting them to events is simple and effective on Facebook. You can\\r\\ncreate the event, specify the location, date, and description, and then invite people to the\\r\\nevent. Everyone who is invited gets a Facebook message and can specify whether she is\\r\\ncoming, maybe coming, or not planning to attend. Facebook Events are a useful tool for\\r\\norganizing community events and getting a rough idea of attendance. Pages\\r\\nFacebook Pages allow you to create a profile page for something (e.g., your community,\\r\\nproduct, etc.). With each page you can post information, pictures, videos, and more, and\\r\\npeople can mark themselves as liking the page. When they like a page, status updates sent\\r\\nto the page will appear in the Facebook Home timeline. Pages are similar to groups but\\r\\nare far more viral; I highly recommend that you set one up for your community.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"5bdabd66-4e40-42d4-ac9d-f1ba69ff49cc":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"5bdabd66-4e40-42d4-ac9d-f1ba69ff49cc\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"AC0kaUgQn0XwLEcfWgE1KeQTsIglPNnvICgColxoXo0=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Tedz5vY7l1czugHzfWFm548Xf6ZLEO9s97Pm+sEuXIc=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"53f1f440-7878-4ca8-a8c5-bbcc54e49533\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"eS0oeD7BproiddRyferUHtTmLbzHrjKSy6FdFaKgdsQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"vl6IdCJkbPcUOgaTjykCSq/McOVzPof9K/X0m40Mxlw=\",\"text\":\"Groups\\r\\nGroups provide a means for creating a place for people to join the group and interact with\\r\\nother group members.

We will discuss\\r\\nthis in more detail later. Google+\\r\\nA later player to the game, Google+ was launched in June 2011 as Google’s offering in the\\r\\nincreasingly popular and competitive social networking space. Thanks to the huge success of\\r\\nTwitter and Facebook, Google was no stranger to competing with them. Google had tried to\\r\\nclaim the social networking crown previously with its failed Google Wave and Google Buzz\\r\\nefforts, and at its launch you could not help but feel that Google+ was going to be Google’s\\r\\nfinal stab at the social networking crown jewels. The site provides a service that is somewhat similar to Facebook: Profile with a means to group\\r\\nfriends in different ways, post photos and videos, and see one another’s status updates. Many\\r\\ninitial reviews called Google+ a “slightly more pleasant-to-use Facebook. ” Where Google+ did\\r\\nget very favorable reviews was in its Hangouts video conferencing functionality, which has had\\r\\nvery positive praise and active use. Google has an uphill climb, though. With Facebook sporting so many profiles from a wide\\r\\nvariety of demographics, many potential users were uninterested in Google+ because their\\r\\nfriends were already on Facebook. Early adopters and tech enthusiasts naturally flocked to\\r\\nGoogle+ right away, and fortunately for Google the growth continued. Within a month,\\r\\nmembership had reached 10 million. At the time of this writing, it is too early to tell whether\\r\\nGoogle’s investment will ultimately pay off and unseat the Facebook king. WHY GOOGLE+ IS INTERESTING\\r\\nGoogle+ provides another social network in which to share and broadcast information about your\\r\\ncommunity, and a means for people to potentially join your community. Today, Google+ is primarily\\r\\nuseful as another avenue of growth in addition to Twitter and Facebook. In my mind, currently the most useful feature in Google+ for community building is its excellent\\r\\nHangouts capability; this is an invaluable tool for community meetings and conflict/dispute\\r\\nresolution sessions. Getting started with Google+\\r\\nGoogle+ works in a similar way to Facebook; you can register a profile and add information\\r\\nabout yourself, add photos, and more. Unlike Facebook, though, in which you have one big\\r\\nfriend list, Google+ lets you group your friends in logical buckets.

Although users can see your friends, they\\r\\ncan’t see which circles they are in, and this feature provides a nice means of grouping together\\r\\nfriends in a way that will not offend anyone. Circles are also useful for gathering groups\\r\\ntogether for hangouts and other discussions. Possibly the most innovative and useful feature in Google+ is Hangouts. A Hangout is an audio\\r\\nand video chat feature that lets you chat with either a person or a group of people. Unlike other\\r\\nvideoconferencing tools, the Hangout feature feels particularly well designed. When you join\\r\\na hangout, you see the other people’s webcams in a row, and when someone talks, a larger\\r\\nvideo view shows that person speaking. This provides a particularly immersive and interactive\\r\\nexperience. I use a hangout for my team meetings (which includes participants from the US,\\r\\nGermany, Spain, and Egypt) and my meetings now feel far more realistic and “in person” than\\r\\nthey did before.

A few months later I was at a work event and heard from a colleague that a few community\\r\\nmembers were concerned that I was working on Severed Fifth content during the day when I\\r\\nshould have been working in the Ubuntu community. I knew that I wasn’t and I defended my\\r\\nhonor vigorously. But then the reality set in. How were folks supposed to know I was off the clock? First, how would they know what time I finish work (many were unclear which time zone I\\r\\nwas in, too), and would they really notice the timestamp and date of the messages I sent out\\r\\non the social networks? I soon realized that the social media world doesn’t really have a concept\\r\\nof off the clock; it is too easy to confuse when you are working with when you are not. The moral of this story is that as a community leader and manager, and particularly if you work\\r\\nfor a company that employs you to work with community, you should ensure that your\\r\\ncommunity has the right impression about when you are and are not working. Although it\\r\\nmay seem like a small detail, the community misinterpreting when you are and are not\\r\\nworking can affect your credibility in the community. A useful technique for avoiding this confusion is to write a blog post or article about the topic,\\r\\nget it out on the table, and explain when you will be working and when you are indulging in\\r\\nspare-time hobbies. NOTE\\r\\nDon’t use your community social media resources for unrelated content.

Social media also makes it devilishly simple for people to\\r\\nshare your news across their social networks, thus continuing to expand your reach.

Many languages have characters that take\\r\\nup more space, so each tweet is limited to fewer characters. Writing these short messages, complete with the links and hashtags that you may want to\\r\\ninclude, can be tough. It definitely takes a little bit of practice.

Avoiding social media overkill\\r\\nAs I mentioned earlier, when I formed the Severed Fifth project, I became something of a social\\r\\nmedia maniac. I registered accounts across almost all of the different social media networks\\r\\nand posted a lot of content. In my earlier story highlighting when you should post, I didn’t\\r\\ndiscuss just how much you should post. Surely this should be simple; I mentioned earlier how you should post a lot of content and post\\r\\nit regularly, so we should post as much as we can, right? Well, kind of. Although getting a community up and running always requires a certain amount of\\r\\nmomentum, there is definitely a risk of social media overkill. Unfortunately, I fell into this trap\\r\\nwith Severed Fifth. When I kicked off the project, not only did I post four or five pieces of content in a day, but I\\r\\nhad also connected my social media services together (more on this later) to ensure that the\\r\\nsame message went out to all the networks. The result of a lot of content cascading across a lot\\r\\nof networks was a bombardment of Severed Fifth information, in epic proportions. While it\\r\\ndemonstrated the sheer level of activity going in the Severed Fifth camp, it ended up weakening\\r\\nmy messaging to some extent because some folks switched it off due to the sheer quantity of\\r\\nmaterial. This was communicated to me when I went to an event and a number of people joked about\\r\\nthe Severed Fifth Propaganda Machine being dialed up to 11. While they were kidding, I could\\r\\ntell that there was an underlying nugget of frustration buried in the humor. The attitude was\\r\\nnews to me, but it was an important lesson; social media is a means to an end, and the means\\r\\nwas impacting the effectiveness of the end.

Feedback\\r\\nHaving great visibility and the ability to take the temperature of your community is critically\\r\\nimportant.

Without boring you with\\r\\nthe details, the controversy was largely born out of the view that this new user interface, known\\r\\nas Unity, was not ready for prime time and that it was inappropriate to replace the previous\\r\\nsolution, known as GNOME, with this young upstart. Opinion was deeply divided in the buildup to the release, and the debates were emotionally\\r\\ncharged and passionate. On release day (Thursday, April 28, 2011) I was bracing myself for the\\r\\nresponse. My view was simple: I was fine with critiques and with people not liking the release,\\r\\nbut I just wanted folks to give it a try and see what they thought for themselves, instead of\\r\\nreading a blogger’s regurgitated bias (whether positive or negative).

Sometimes, being more up-front and frank is a useful way to get your questions answered. As\\r\\nan example, if you are curious to see what your community (or the wider community of\\r\\nonlookers and enthusiasts) thinks about a particular topic, it can often be useful to just ask\\r\\nthem on your social networks (or using a particular Twitter hashtag) and see how they respond. Asking such questions can often result in your community having a very positive impression\\r\\nof you because your openness and willingness to seek feedback from the community tells them\\r\\nyou care about them as a community manager and leader. Before asking for feedback, though, make sure you have a way in which you can see the\\r\\nresponses. For Facebook and Google+ this is simple: each message you post also has a\\r\\ncommenting feature for people to leave their responses neatly connected to your message. For\\r\\nTwitter, though, you should either explicitly ask people to direct their feedback to you, or even\\r\\nbetter, use a hashtag.

Collaboration\\r\\nIn March 2011 I had a brainwave. Shocking, I know. Back then, my wife, Erica, was about to turn 30 and I wanted to do something special for her. Using a combination of guile and cunning I organized a surprise party for her at our house. The party, while fun, is not the interesting point of this story; social media is what makes this\\r\\nrelevant. Putting together the party was more challenging than you would think. I needed to do a\\r\\nnumber of things:\\r\\n•   Invite a bunch of our friends to the party. •   Invite people who are friends with Erica but for whom I didn’t have contact details. •   Get an idea of who was coming and who couldn’t make it. •   Coordinate with others about who wanted to bring food, who was bringing booze, who\\r\\nwanted to help put up decorations, and other elements. •   Provide a means for attendees to communicate with one another so that they could\\r\\ncoordinate a carpool, crash space, and so on. What’s more, I needed to do all of this in secret so that Erica would not get a hint of what was\\r\\ngoing on. Given that we both work from home, this was going to be challenging; it made phone\\r\\ncalls and face-to-face discussions with coconspirators difficult. To achieve this, I used Facebook for everything. First I created a private event (private events\\r\\ndon’t show up in the search results) and invited all the friends I could think of who I knew\\r\\nshe would want there. Then I looked through Erica’s friend list and friended the folks for whom\\r\\nI did not have contact details so that I could invite them, too. With the Facebook event having a communication area (the Wall), this provided a great means\\r\\nfor us to collaborate as a group around the event.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a4a7a337-bcac-479c-bf6c-f591e4c87364":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a4a7a337-bcac-479c-bf6c-f591e4c87364\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"vSE4PVxVjLB9jr3q6KHogAQtxzX98QG1OPvB/NdBhpQ=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"BEoUbz5LxepMpIZB2UqBLM7/nChoGwv33IkUV3i+NcE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"6912a83d-eec8-4574-8626-b4014f970ab6\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"y4WiNFh0Cijc/lOQ2tbQaEfGLuVbjFzTVA3yIDyD6y8=\"}},\"hash\":\"SRQRPjoNL6vv65TayCArPxbc27suLEIKLe9VtWTh0fU=\",\"text\":\"People volunteered to bring food, and could\\r\\nask me what pots and pans we had, how many plates we needed, when everyone should arrive,\\r\\nand other questions.

She had absolutely no idea beforehand and was\\r\\nflabbergasted when she found out, and everyone had a great time at the party. This was a case of a small community forming around a goal (making the party fun for Erica\\r\\nand everyone else), with social media providing the perfect engine to make it happen, along\\r\\nwith the tools we needed to accomplish a great outcome. Social media made it simple for me\\r\\nto bring people into our little community, and there was no learning curve required as\\r\\neveryone already knew how to use Facebook. It was a great example of focused collaboration. Of course, there are many different forms of collaboration, and when assessing what\\r\\ncollaborative opportunities are available to us in our communities, we often need to assess\\r\\nwhat tools we have available because these affect what we can do. Collaboration is difficult to\\r\\nkick-start if people don’t have the tools they require to participate. We discussed this more in\\r\\nChapter 5. Social media is heavily optimized toward some forms of collaboration and not others. As an\\r\\nexample, social networks are fantastic for communication, but at the time of this writing they\\r\\nlack tools for collaborating around art and media, around code and software, and around\\r\\ndocuments. Of course, by the time you read this, the situation may well have changed, but\\r\\ntoday I see three primary opportunities for collaboration using social media:\\r\\nCommunication\\r\\nThe vast majority of content that occurs in social networks involves communication\\r\\nbetween individuals and among groups. Using my example of Erica’s party, all of the\\r\\ncollaboration there was focused on planning who would work on what and disseminating\\r\\ninformation to the group. Social networks are excellent resources for this. Campaigns and awareness\\r\\nSocial networks are energized by your connecting to people you want to be connected to,\\r\\nas well as opening up the potential to connect to many others you don’t know. Campaigns\\r\\nand growing awareness are fueled by hitting momentum with a message, and social media\\r\\nis ideal for this kind of work. Events\\r\\nAs I discussed earlier, social media is also ideal for collaborating around events. Let’s now look in more detail at each of these areas.

In reality, though, their definition of collaboration was much simpler. Their community was\\r\\npopulated by many separate businesses and organizations spread all over the US, and they\\r\\nwanted to see different members of these businesses sharing their experience, knowledge, and\\r\\ninsight where it made sense to solve problems, thus providing a useful and valuable resource\\r\\nfor everyone. This didn’t require any fancy tools. It didn’t need special methods of sharing content. It just\\r\\nneeded a private social environment in which people could communicate safely and openly\\r\\nwith one another. We used a social network for that, and the results were well received by the\\r\\nmembers. What is wonderful about most social media networks (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+) is\\r\\nthat they not only provide excellent tools for you and your colleagues to communicate with\\r\\none another, but also allow you to pick and choose how these discussions are presented and\\r\\nto whom. As an example, the Ubuntu community wants their discussions to be accessible and\\r\\nopen to all, but the contracting association example I just described needed a by-invitation-\\r\\nonly policy and a private environment. Social media provides this flexibility. Facebook has a feature called Facebook Groups that is particularly useful for these kinds of\\r\\ncommunication-oriented communities. I recommend you take a look. NOTE\\r\\nGoogle and Yahoo! also provide similar group services. These includes facilities for\\r\\ncontrolling membership, having discussions, and other features.

It was a popular event and we loved putting it together. This all\\r\\nhappened largely before the social media phenomenon kicked off, and it was much more\\r\\ncomplex to organize the event back then. The reason for this is that LugRadio Live was fueled by the time and resources contributed by\\r\\ncommunity members on their own to help the event be successful. People would loan us\\r\\nprojectors, PA systems, and funding for the event. They would come and help form the crew\\r\\nto construct the stage, set up the chairs, help the presenters, and more. Such a collaborative\\r\\ncommunity event hinged on how all these moving parts worked together, and before social\\r\\nmedia we coordinated this work with literally hundreds of emails going out to a set of core\\r\\ncontributors. These days, you can create a Facebook event and coordinate everything there. Facebook events\\r\\nare not useful for gauging attendance, but they are useful for providing a sense that everyone\\r\\ncan participate in his own way, and you will find people contributing their time and services\\r\\nin pleasantly surprising and unexpected ways.

You will probably want\\r\\nto reach out to as many people as possible, and writing a message and posting it individually\\r\\nto each network can quickly become a real pain. For instance, when I started using social media, I would create a message on Twitter and then\\r\\ncut and paste it to identi.ca and then also to Facebook. With the addition of Google+, Diaspora,\\r\\nReverbNation, MySpace, and others, this took a lot of time. The glorious dream for many of us is to write our message once and see it posted automatically\\r\\nto each network. Fortunately, there are some tools and methods for doing this. In general, they\\r\\ncan be categorized as client-side or server-side solutions. On the client side, you can install an application that allows you to post to multiple networks. As an example, the Gwibber client that I use in Ubuntu allows me to post to Twitter, Facebook,\\r\\nidenti.ca, and many other networks. This means that not only can I type in a message once\\r\\nand it gets posted to each service, but also the replies are collated into a single list.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0b8d4236-6f42-4ecf-a55d-202319fd316f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0b8d4236-6f42-4ecf-a55d-202319fd316f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"V8kudA4wY3emVDowkrCZFBx1mgJZmtQ18R+BbUV0i8Y=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"P9WWNg7xeM2JHmS9J5uV+T4n0G8EruDI1JMWd6YUJg4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5dd594e4-c8ed-4bb2-aa22-a0ec923ffc7e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ANG+XEC+mUxoC+a9TVy12BTnGrbd1YPg52aHfRPF9Nw=\"}},\"hash\":\"OpINKxasJLaTSlHRy9i5DfEy1JTk8BVZgkBwUNWXSfg=\",\"text\":\"Many applications offer this functionality, and I recommend that you see which works best\\r\\nfor you.

The social media wannabes that I so delicately derided at the beginning of the chapter often\\r\\nobsess about the technology, but speak less about the social rules of engagement that come\\r\\ninto play when using these resources. In our position as community leaders and managers we often have to be particularly socially\\r\\nsavvy, and this is especially true when using social media. While the 140-character limit in\\r\\nTwitter is useful for keeping messages concise, it also brings some challenges in how we\\r\\ncommunicate, particularly on sensitive topics. Here are a few tips for overcoming these\\r\\nchallenges:\\r\\nBe mindful of your tone\\r\\nRemember that when you are using social media many different people are reading your\\r\\ncontent. This includes people from different walks of life and different countries and\\r\\ncultures, people who know you at different levels, and people who have differing opinions\\r\\nof you and your community. As such, mind the tone you use, and try to be loose and\\r\\nsocial, yet professional. Be appropriate\\r\\nOne of the challenges I have faced over the years is that of striving to always be appropriate,\\r\\nyet breaking the ice enough that people can relax around me. A stiff, formal community\\r\\nmanager is a bore, but a lewd, offensive community manager won’t last long in a\\r\\ncommunity. I always try to be professional and respectful, but also show my social side,\\r\\nposting messages about music, my life, and my family, as well as various amusing duck-\\r\\nrelated photos. Being appropriate does not mean being boring, it just means being mindful\\r\\nof not causing undue offense. Don’t always wear the flame suit\\r\\nYour community, your members, and you are likely to be the victims of flaming, bickering,\\r\\nand trolling at some point. I have seen many community managers feel the need to\\r\\nrespond to every message and have the last word. Don’t succumb to this temptation.

As I settled into the brutal\\r\\nwriting schedule, I was excited about the book, but I still felt like something was missing. Seemingly being someone who prefers to replace sleep with heartburn, I decided there was\\r\\none additional thing I wanted to work on: a central event and meeting place for community\\r\\nmanagers. Like many community managers, I had traveled around the world, trudging from conference\\r\\nto conference to talk up my communities, but I had little opportunity to sit down with other\\r\\ncommunity managers, including those from competing companies, to discuss our craft. Back\\r\\nthen, community management was still very much in its infancy, so I assumed the attendance\\r\\nwould be fairly small, and an intimate event could generate some really great discussion.

To do this I set up a series of social media resources in addition to the event’s home page. First,\\r\\nI created a Facebook Event for the event. In it I added all the logistical details of when and\\r\\nwhere the event was to take place, links to the website, links to travel and hotel details, and\\r\\nso on. I also created a vibrant image for the Facebook Event to attract people to click on it (I\\r\\nincluded the dates of the event in the picture to really drill the information into people’s minds). In addition to adding the boilerplate details, I posted some content to the Wall to provide a\\r\\nsense that the event was already active. I posted some links to content on the website, details\\r\\nabout the focus of the event, attendee details, and more. Having created the event, I then invited all of my friends on Facebook who would likely be\\r\\ninterested or available to attend. When you create a Facebook Event you get an indication of\\r\\nwhether people can attend, may attend, or won’t attend. This was a useful indicator of likely\\r\\nattendance, although for a free event like the Community Leadership Summit, it is normal for\\r\\npeople to say they will attend and then not show up. (In my experience, 50% of the people\\r\\nwho say they will attend free events actually do show up. )\\r\\nAt this point I was waiting for people to see the invitation on Facebook and hopefully mark\\r\\nthe event in their calendars. Now I needed to expand the publicity of the event across other\\r\\nsocial networks and resources.

I posted this on my blog first because it\\r\\nis aggregated across a number of other resources (e.g., some news sites related to the\\r\\ncommunities I manage).

Providing Community Updates\\r\\nOne of the most effective uses of social media is to disseminate news and information about\\r\\nwhat is going on in your community. This is something we have used extensively in Ubuntu\\r\\nand I want to share a few tips and tricks here. You should make a point of ensuring that your community is well represented across the social\\r\\nmedia networks. Be sure to register a Twitter account for your community, a page for it on\\r\\nFacebook, and information on other networks where appropriate.

Delicately held under my arm was a large cardboard\\r\\npenguin and a spindle of Linux CDs. This was a special day: Microsoft Windows 2000 was\\r\\nreleased. Just a few weeks before, on the other side of the world in Arizona, Deepak Saxena had an idea. With the looming release of Windows 2000, Deepak wanted to see Linux user groups and open\\r\\nsource enthusiasts take to the streets to spread the word of open source. Deepak saw the\\r\\nopportunity, and was determined to make it count. He decided to convert a major milestone\\r\\nfor Windows into a “Linux Demo Day” when thousands of Linux supporters would evangelize\\r\\ntheir love of free software. Within a few weeks, Deepak had persuaded many of the companies in the Linux space—\\r\\nincluding Caldera, EST, Linuxcare, Linux Central, Linux Mall, Red Hat, SGI, SuSE, Turbo\\r\\nLinux, and TuxTops—to contribute to his cause. He had publicity from some of the largest\\r\\nonline tech news sites, and over 150 Linux user groups interested in joining in. Deepak’s little\\r\\nidea had become a coordinated worldwide effort. 1.

Throughout the day, we explained and reexplained why open source was important. We talked\\r\\nabout the ethos, the belief, and the community. We applied our enthusiasm to the slightly\\r\\nbemused subjects before us. It was a long day, but as we drove back to our native\\r\\nWolverhampton, we were proud of our efforts.

Despite career\\r\\nsuccess, Jamie was not content. He wanted to change something very specific: school meals. The United Kingdom faced serious health problems in school kids. Obesity had doubled. Eighty\\r\\npercent of kids predominantly ate junk food, and the food parents were giving them was not\\r\\nexactly healthy. In a typical lunchbox, 55% of kids got potato crisps, 40% got a chocolate bar,\\r\\nand 33% got a carton of a sugary drink. A significant part of the problem had to do with the meals served to kids each lunchtime in\\r\\nschool cafeterias across the country. Every day, 3.2 million kids were served on a budget of\\r\\nmerely 68p. Unfortunately, that 68p was seemingly funding fried food and other junk. Jamie wanted change. Although he had a television show about the topic and a reputation,\\r\\nhe knew he couldn’t change this alone. He worked hard to make the issue one that the nation\\r\\ncared about. Articles, blogs, radio shows, and other mediums were behind Jamie’s campaign. After a few months, it seemed that healthy school meals were the hot topic all over England. Jamie achieved mindshare. With mindshare came change: meetings with the prime minister, new government guidelines,\\r\\nand better school meals for kids.

While some of you reading this book may have a marketing background, it is important to\\r\\nstress that traditional marketing strategies probably won’t wash with your community. You\\r\\ncan’t rely on press releases and advertising; you can’t depend on buzzwords and slogans; and\\r\\noften you can’t easily measure the impact of your message. Whereas marketing traditionally\\r\\nrequires a budget, no budget is required here. Buzz in this world is subtler and more organic. While we are making comparisons to traditional marketing, it is also important to note that\\r\\nthe process of building buzz in community does not need to be centralized. You don’t need to\\r\\nappoint a marketing manager for the community and have everything go through him. You\\r\\nshould instead encourage everyone in your community to learn the skills behind building\\r\\ngreat buzz.

Second, developing a mission statement trains you to describe your goals\\r\\nand excitement succinctly. The mission is what will pique the interest of your next generation\\r\\nof community members. The ideal mission statement is concise, specific, and functional; we worship vigorously at the\\r\\naltar of conciseness.

Politics? Sexy? Although too many politicians focus on themselves, politics is an activity engaged in by\\r\\ncommunities. Political parties in democratic countries cannot achieve their goals without\\r\\nwidespread support from those they govern. They gather this support by presenting a dream\\r\\nof the future that appeals to the electorate. Each of these activities has parallels with\\r\\ncommunity building. The similarities go further. Politics is, in essence, not all that interesting. Political parties spend\\r\\ntheir days arguing over policies, manifestos, taxes, inflation, and the other details of\\r\\ngovernment. Around election time they have to transform these eye-glazingly mundane\\r\\nconcepts into exciting statements that inspire a nation. An interesting example of this happened in 1996. Putting political persuasions to one side, let’s\\r\\nexplore how the New Labour party built momentum around its political initiatives. It all started\\r\\nwhen a rather young and grinning Tony Blair became the leader of the opposition party in the\\r\\nUnited Kingdom. Back then the country was deeply dissatisfied with the ruling Conservative Party. Prime\\r\\nMinister John Major had failed to enthuse the country, and the party was riddled with\\r\\nallegations of sleaze and political unrest. But despite multiple attempts to gain power, the\\r\\nLabour party had failed to unseat the ruling Tories for 18 years. Labour was branded by many\\r\\nwith a “second-prize” political reputation. Then, Tony Blair gave birth to his concept of New Labour. He was personable and different,\\r\\nan instant antithesis to the plain and stuffy political norms of the day. Blair formed his team\\r\\nand came bounding into visibility with his mantra of “New Labour: Because Britain Deserves\\r\\nBetter. ”\\r\\nBlair wanted to enthuse the electorate. Reams of inspiring, motivational language were\\r\\nunleashed on an unsuspecting British public. Consider these examples from the 1997 election\\r\\nmanifesto (see http://australianpolitics.com/uk/labour/97-labour-manifesto.shtml):\\r\\nI believe in Britain.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"f8f76c60-a779-49ab-99ec-06df7746d5e0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"f8f76c60-a779-49ab-99ec-06df7746d5e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"Z62kluNR0oBUGv47xGORYmfr4Y1aJzzm167C0S5WIyM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Jld6EaTEuLsAtvRPQwwpHhqy8LeRWMrNF9bz9mX4svM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"bb24e3b6-161b-49f7-98d4-abff10620e47\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"rNtfMYkftri5/kKRH7bConNu7zrocRNxJ57juX1uk18=\"}},\"hash\":\"dDSRBiZ9Hi9BAAANfdXcUdZtAbKL1DoGcGRL6L6hWxc=\",\"text\":\"It is a great country with a great history.

Although younger than his opposition, Blair was a savvy political player. He knew that the\\r\\nBritish public had lost faith not only in the Tories, but also in politics itself. He knew that the\\r\\nfirst time people read, watched, or heard about New Labour, he had only seconds to grab them\\r\\nand build their support. He needed to build buzz, quickly and efficiently. As part of this, he developed what Labour called a “Pledge Card. ” This small card was carried\\r\\nby politicians and listed five concrete promises. Back then, the combination of “concrete\\r\\npromises” and “politicians” was not typical in British politics. Blair’s approach was honest and\\r\\nfrank, and the nation responded.

The most important tip to\\r\\nremember about inspirational messaging is that it must be genuine. Whatever path we follow\\r\\nto build our communities, our leaders must instill a sense of trust and representation. The\\r\\nenemy here is in appearing contrived and disingenuous. Our inspiration must be natural and\\r\\ngenuine. If you are real, your community will see that. Unfortunately, it’s easy to risk being seen as a fake. The word community has been twisted and\\r\\ncontorted to mean many things over the years, some of which don’t exactly fall in line with\\r\\nwhat many of us would consider a community. The reason for this is that the word community almost always conjures up a positive mental\\r\\nimage. It alludes to togetherness, compassion, and equality. As such, it has been a target of\\r\\nhype and hot air. If an organization, company, or individual wants to be seen in a positive and\\r\\nengaging light, liberal use of the word community makes sense. There will always be a natural tension between the inspiring speaker and the audience. The\\r\\nspeaker will always have a goal or agenda of her own, but needs to strike a balance between\\r\\nhonesty around her personal ambitions and an assurance that she takes the wider values of\\r\\nthe community to heart. If your definition of community does not extend to the common expectation of volunteer\\r\\nenvironments, you will receive short shrift quickly. Readers seeking to build communities\\r\\naround commercial products should be particularly cognizant of this risk. Always remember\\r\\nthat whatever their focus, communities are organic units of interest and collaboration. They\\r\\nlive and breathe on an understanding that community efforts benefit the community as a\\r\\nwhole. Anyone who tampers with that ethos will face problems.

Some (not all) salespeople exemplify the philosophy of “I could sell ice to\\r\\nEskimos. ” In other words, they take pride in their ability to make the sale. The pride is in being\\r\\nconvincing and charismatic. As such, salespeople are often able to detach themselves from the\\r\\nproduct they are selling. They can effectively work for any company that sells something. I used to work at OpenAdvantage, a government-funded organization tasked with spreading\\r\\nopen source software in the West Midlands region of England. Every year my colleagues and\\r\\nI worked with hundreds of businesses, charities, educational and governmental institutions,\\r\\nand individuals. OpenAdvantage was a vendor-neutral playground.

Whether your community is focused around technology,\\r\\nknitting, animal welfare, supporting the poor, or otherwise, a website is a critical resource that\\r\\nyou should build and maintain. The ubiquity of the Internet and the low cost of equipment to\\r\\nview it have made an online presence the storefront for your community.

Write this down and stick it on your wall. Tattoo your children with it if you need to. Let’s\\r\\nbreak this down into key areas. Keep these aspects in mind when considering how to build\\r\\nyour site:\\r\\nGreat overview\\r\\nIf I visit your website, I want to be able to get an overview of the community, its goals,\\r\\nand how to get involved, all within the space of a few minutes. This information should\\r\\nbe up-front, easy to access, and easy to read, and should have a simple web address that\\r\\nyou can point people to (e.g., www.myproject.com/overview). Great documentation\\r\\nYour website should provide documentation and guidance for all aspects of your\\r\\ncommunity. This will always be an ongoing process, but you should consider which aspects\\r\\nof your community are most important and need to be documented. As an example, the\\r\\nprocess that new members follow to join your community should be a priority. Great communication\\r\\nYou should ensure that it is really easy for people to get in touch with you with questions,\\r\\nsuggestions, and feedback. I recommend that at a minimum you have an email address\\r\\nthat is easy to access. This is a notable problem with many blogs. Many blogging tools (such\\r\\nas WordPress at the time of this writing) do not provide an easy-to-access contact link,\\r\\nand this can make it impossible to get in touch with the author of the blog.

Of course, those two terms are somewhat\\r\\nintermingled: content about your community that is on your website from 1998 is probably\\r\\nnot going to be all that accurate anymore. Creating current content is a two-part process. First, your community processes and\\r\\nmethodologies need to be up-to-date. There is nothing more frustrating than joining a\\r\\ncommunity, following the published guidelines to get involved, and then being told that the\\r\\nguidelines are out of date and that you need to adjust your work. That is a surefire way to\\r\\nannoy new contributors. The second area, and the area that fits in neatly with buzz, is news and updates. Your site needs\\r\\nto be a window to exciting content about the community, and this window needs to be updated\\r\\nregularly. If you want people to keep coming back to your website, you need to give them a\\r\\nreason. That reason is fresh content. You should build a strategy for publishing news. This in itself may seem like a simple task. I\\r\\nknow what you are thinking: “Jono, I will just regularly post something new to the website. Simple! ” Not quite. Many communities struggle with regular updates. People simply get busy. People get distracted. Other priorities in the community take over. If all of your news gets posted by one person, and\\r\\nthat person decides to spend evenings redecorating a house instead, you lose. When people\\r\\nget busy, they tend to drop nonessential and nonfun tasks. News updates are often one of these\\r\\nfirst casualties. So divide this work among a number of contributors. Find three or four people who are happy\\r\\nto update the news site, and talk to one another about what news you are going to post.

There is, however, another approach to\\r\\nkeeping your site alive: conversation. The Internet has become an incredible place to have\\r\\nconversations. Countless forums, websites, and blogs have provided a medium in which\\r\\nanything and everything can be discussed. You should ensure that your website is in on the\\r\\naction. Conversation and commenting facilities are an incredible way to make visitors feel that they\\r\\nhave input into the community. These facilities are typically fairly simple: a blog or news entry\\r\\nis posted, and readers can leave a comment underneath the content to share their thoughts. This has two benefits:\\r\\nRegular content\\r\\nConversation is content that other people provide to your website. Your visitors will come\\r\\nback to participate in the conversation, and your website will always be fresh and full of\\r\\nnew and interesting things to read. Engagement\\r\\nAllowing any visitor to the website to post an opinion or comment is an incredible\\r\\nstatement about engagement. Providing this facility says to all of your visitors that your\\r\\nsite is open and always welcoming comments. These two features in themselves are justification enough for having these facilities on your\\r\\nwebsite, but there is one reason that is even more important: community. If you allow people to participate on your website, building a reputation tied to their name,\\r\\ncommunity will thrive on your website. Community growth is our end game, and growth\\r\\nhappens around conversations. I have experienced this in a number of places, with the most personal being my own website\\r\\nat http://www.jonobacon.org/. For a number of years I have had comment facilities on my site,\\r\\nand over the years I have developed a regular readership that comes back to contribute to the\\r\\ntopics of the posts. If this is possible on an individual’s website, just imagine what is possible\\r\\non a community’s website! KEEPING THE CONVERSATION FLOWING\\r\\nProviding commenting facilities is only the beginning of growing community on your website. To\\r\\ndo this you will need to be more proactive than normal in encouraging conversation. Here are some\\r\\nquick tips:\\r\\n• Be responsive. View every comment to your website as seeking a response. Respond and ask\\r\\nquestions to keep the comments coming in.

There are a number of preexisting tools that will do the\\r\\njob perfectly. The easiest method of getting going is to use a blogging engine. A blogging engine is a software tool that lives on a website and provides a simple interface for\\r\\nyou to publish an article. You can use an editor to format the article in different ways (make\\r\\nparts bold, italic, or underlined, provide different headings, links, or images, etc.), and you can\\r\\nalso split the posts into different categories. These systems do not require any programming\\r\\nabilities. There are many free online services for setting up blogs, and with them you can get up and\\r\\nrunning quickly. They allow you to publish your blog entries and ensure that they are indexed\\r\\nby popular search engines, such as Google. Unfortunately, many of these services don’t allow\\r\\nyou to have your blog at your own web address. If you would prefer the blog to be on the same domain as your website, you can install your\\r\\nown blogging engine. There are many free and commercial blogging engines available, but I\\r\\nrecommend WordPress. WordPress offers an excellent, easy-to-use, and powerful framework\\r\\nfor publishing content easily. To install your own WordPress website, you will need to have\\r\\nyour own server, which you can purchase from a hosting company. The company will provide\\r\\na place to install the software, and you can set it up.

Years ago I wrote my own\\r\\nwebsite engine, and it just wasn’t as good as something such as WordPress. It’s fairly simple to see\\r\\nwhy: a project such as WordPress has hundreds of developers creating new features and fixing\\r\\nproblems. This nets more functionality and a more stable experience in general. If you really feel the need to have your own custom website, ensure that you have the resources to\\r\\nmaintain it for a long time. When you invest in that website today, you will need to be able to still\\r\\ninvest in its maintenance in a year, in two years, or more. Think carefully about this decision: if you\\r\\ngo with a preexisting engine such as WordPress, that maintenance is done for you. Syndication\\r\\nIn the past five years there has been a change in how people access content on the Internet. Traditionally, the only way you could get updates from a website was to repeatedly visit the\\r\\nwebsite to check for new content or features. This meant having a number of bookmarks in\\r\\nyour web browser and cycling through them hunting for updates. Fortunately, a solution to\\r\\nthis problem has been developed, known as syndicated feeds. Once the forte of the techie, they\\r\\nare now popular across the Internet. When you use a blogging website engine (such as WordPress), each time you add a new entry,\\r\\na special feed will be updated with the content. This feed sits on the same website. Your readers\\r\\ncan then use a piece of software called a feed reader to subscribe to the feed. As an example, on my website at http://www.jonobacon.org/, I have a feed available at http://www\\r\\n.jonobacon.org/feed/. This is a Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed. NOTE\\r\\nA good introduction to these feeds is on the BBC website at http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/\\r\\nhi/help/3223484.stm. With most websites providing these feeds, you can subscribe to a number of your favorite\\r\\nwebsites in your feed reader. Each time you load the reader, it will check each feed for updates\\r\\nand indicate if there is new content.

SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION\\r\\nA popular buzzword in the online world is search engine optimization (SEO). It is the science of\\r\\nhow to ensure that your website appears at the top of search engines. It is a large and complex\\r\\nscience, but I want to give you just a few quick tips that will get you started:\\r\\n•Using preexisting engines can make this easier. When you use a blogging engine, the creators\\r\\nof the engine have likely already thought about optimizing for search engines. This will\\r\\nautomatically get you higher rankings. • Make sure titles and headings (which factor heavily in searches) are meaningful and contain\\r\\nthe words people will look for. It’s OK to have a cutesy title like “Why I’m tired this morning,”\\r\\nbut also include some meaningful indicator of the content, such as “...because I finished the\\r\\nBike for MS research fundraiser. ”\\r\\n• When posting images inside your news/blog posts, ensure that you specify some text to\\r\\ndescribe the image. This is done in the alt attribute of the image tag. For example:\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"My Dog\\\" src=\\\"dog.jpg\\\">\\r\\n•Comment and conversation facilities will increase your SEO by bringing regular traffic to your\\r\\nwebsite and encouraging links. The key to SEO is to have great content that attracts regular traffic. Focus your efforts on getting more\\r\\npeople to your website, and your SEO rating will flourish. The Buzz Cycle\\r\\nSo far in this chapter we have explored many of the wider considerations for building buzz. Before we move on to look at some specific examples, we need to learn the final piece of\\r\\nbuzz theory: the buzz cycle. Whenever you build buzz, you execute a set of procedures. When combined, this set of\\r\\nprocedures ensures that you plan effectively, get as much anticipation for your announcement,\\r\\n210   CHAPTER SEVEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d5c23d8e-378f-405f-a3b0-173b0dfeb325":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d5c23d8e-378f-405f-a3b0-173b0dfeb325\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cB8Bk2hu2rAugpSTcuQn98jwKxtUXt+FsdHslC1vE5w=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"uubauPbQsv+i5URGq4BJ3nsSd46T5avBkCXV5woqHm4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c1792cb8-102b-4603-8bc1-5bb4feed2e0b\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"63mVMViuH4JtcyeOkp3P3+A55MD4pjl3IuH/zOFZQn0=\"}},\"hash\":\"xaDDWI0qbOr6nM6qSvzN3y6ZKOwg+KRjDCe8OhOfGW4=\",\"text\":\"and learn from the experience. These steps help frame the best practice involved in buzz\\r\\nmaking, and they will help you to better plan and structure how you get people excited about\\r\\nyour community. The four stages are:\\r\\nPlan\\r\\nAt this stage you sit down and build a recipe for what you want to achieve, how you can\\r\\nachieve it, and what is involved. Build up\\r\\nInstead of going straight to the main course, why not start with an appetizer? Build up\\r\\nsome excitement and mystery before the main event kicks in. Announce\\r\\nThe core of our buzz, this is where we kick it out there. Review\\r\\nThis includes a postmortem of what we did, and an assessment of what worked, what\\r\\ndidn’t, and how we can improve next time. Many newcomers to the buzz-building business jump straight to the announcement, with a\\r\\nmarginal level of planning. I strongly recommend against this. Buzz is an art form that can net\\r\\nincredible results for your community when executed correctly, but it can also cause lasting\\r\\ndamage if you get it wrong. Planning and feedback will keep you with the former. To explain\\r\\nhow each stage is important, I am going to use the 5-A-Day example that we talked about back\\r\\nin Chapter 4 that illustrates the buzz cycle well. 5-A-Day was a project I conceived while watching a program about healthy eating. In many\\r\\ncountries it is recommended that you eat five portions of fruit or vegetables as part of a healthy\\r\\ndiet. It makes healthy eating an easy-to-remember metric that people can factor into their\\r\\nroutine, which is a compelling concept. Around that time, we were very conscious of how we handled our bug list. As Ubuntu grew\\r\\nas a project, the number of users grew; as such, so did the number of reported bugs. Inspired\\r\\nby five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, we formed the 5-A-Day initiative to encourage\\r\\nour community to triage or comment on five bugs a day. The project started and made some\\r\\nincredible progress. Now let’s look at the different buzz stages with this example as an\\r\\nillustration. Planning\\r\\nThe reason buzz requires planning is that, to excite people, you need to know your goals, what\\r\\ntools and resources you need, and how to roll out your plan.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c1792cb8-102b-4603-8bc1-5bb4feed2e0b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c1792cb8-102b-4603-8bc1-5bb4feed2e0b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cB8Bk2hu2rAugpSTcuQn98jwKxtUXt+FsdHslC1vE5w=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"uubauPbQsv+i5URGq4BJ3nsSd46T5avBkCXV5woqHm4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d5c23d8e-378f-405f-a3b0-173b0dfeb325\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"xaDDWI0qbOr6nM6qSvzN3y6ZKOwg+KRjDCe8OhOfGW4=\"}},\"hash\":\"63mVMViuH4JtcyeOkp3P3+A55MD4pjl3IuH/zOFZQn0=\",\"text\":\"You want to squeeze as much\\r\\njuice out of your efforts as possible and get as much focus and attention on your community\\r\\nas possible.

It’s important that we put our announcement in the proper perspective: it will be one of\\r\\nhundreds of things the person will read on the Internet that day. We need to stand out. We\\r\\nneed to grab the reader’s attention and deliver our content. Nielsen’s solution to this problem is simple: write half as much. In his excellent article “Be\\r\\nSuccinct! (Writing for the Web)”, Nielsen recommends three guidelines that can help:\\r\\n•   Be succinct: write no more than 50% of the text you would have used in a hardcopy\\r\\npublication. •   Write for scannability: don’t require users to read long, continuous blocks of text. •   Use hypertext to split up long information into multiple pages. We are trying to avoid swathes of text. We need to architect our announcement so that our\\r\\nreaders can skip over parts and get straight to the meat. Let’s look at an example.

Let’s get back to our 5-A-Day example. When we were constructing the 5-A-Day\\r\\nannouncement, we produced a page that identified the primary concept of 5-A-Day, how\\r\\npeople could get involved, and what they needed to do. Each different piece of information\\r\\nhad individual headings, and emphasis was used extensively. View the page at https://wiki\\r\\n.ubuntu.com/5-A-Day to see the principles in this section in action—and with a successful\\r\\noutcome. Review\\r\\nPostmortems are hugely valuable in any kind of work, and if you don’t perform them, you\\r\\nnever learn how to improve. Whether you are evaluating how well you handled a discussion,\\r\\ncooked a meal, taught your kids how to play football, or built community buzz, a review can\\r\\nuncover great opportunities for improvement:\\r\\nEfficiency\\r\\nWhen you review your work, it gives you an opportunity to identify areas that are\\r\\ninefficient and redundant. You can use these as a basis for improvement. Feedback\\r\\nGathering feedback from the people who consumed your buzz is a great way to see what\\r\\nthey felt worked and what didn’t.

In the review phase, revisit the questions you asked in the planning phase and compare the\\r\\nplan with what happened:\\r\\n•   Did you stick to your aim and communicate it well to others? •   Did you identify the right outcomes to achieve? •   Were your chosen mediums the most suitable? •   Did you prepare effectively? •Did you communicate well to others involved in the buzz about what needed to be done? •   Was your timeline for the buzz cycle accurate? Did you hit your deadlines? To make this process effective, you should gather feedback from members of your community. Seek to gather responses from those who will provide you with constructive advice of what\\r\\nworked and what didn’t. Remember, much of the goal here is to identify flaws in your\\r\\napproach. Flaws are nothing to be embarrassed about: they are opportunities to do even better\\r\\nnext time. Later in the book, we are going to talk about measuring community, and we will be able to\\r\\nuse many of the techniques there to help us review our work. Buzz Targets\\r\\nBuzz needs a target, and that target is the topic you are focusing on. Each time you steal\\r\\nsomeone’s attention, she needs to know that it was worth it. You want to ensure that when\\r\\nshe looks in your direction, she feels it was worthwhile. To do this, you need to decide what you want to promote. Of course, buzz is an ongoing process:\\r\\nyou will need to bring attention and focus to your community many, many times. Each time\\r\\nyou need to ensure that there is a purpose. Whether the purpose is announcing the\\r\\ncommunity, attracting new members, or anything else, you should ensure that your goals and\\r\\nintentions are clear. Two kinds of buzz campaigns are useful in virtually all communities:\\r\\n•   The initial announcement\\r\\n•   Ongoing efforts to attract members\\r\\nWe are going to explore both of these, looking at the four elements of the buzz cycle.

The goal is to get the\\r\\nmessage out among people who can contribute to your community, pique people’s interest,\\r\\nand get them to learn more. Your announcement should appear fresh and exciting, and an effective buildup phase is\\r\\nparticularly important. Earlier I gave examples of the approach to announcing The Art of\\r\\nCommunity and 5-A-Day; you should consider similar approaches. Multimedia can make an announcement more exciting and memorable. Lawrence Lessig\\r\\nlaunched his Change Congress campaign on his blog by recording a short online presentation\\r\\nin which he narrated the goals of the project. I used a similar technique when I announced\\r\\nmy Severed Fifth project. I recorded an announcement and put it online on the day of release. These approaches really help captivate the viewer. The desired outcome with this kind of buzz is to have people visit your website and to spread\\r\\nawareness of your community. Applying the buzz cycle\\r\\nPreparation\\r\\nEnsure that you have your website in place, and that all of the key information about your\\r\\ncommunity and how to get involved is available. You should also ensure that syndication\\r\\nfeeds are available. Decide where it’s important to get mentioned (websites, magazines,\\r\\npersonal blogs by leaders in the field, etc.). You can often source a list of places by asking\\r\\nyour community and identifying related websites and magazines. Buildup\\r\\nIf you have a preexisting blog or other site where you can post content, you could post\\r\\n“Coming Soon... ” messages. If you are setting up a local community, you could put up\\r\\nfliers with the date of the announcement and a web address.

You should provide a short blurb that inspires people to learn about your\\r\\ncommunity and encourage them to visit your website.

There’s also qualitative feedback: did comments and questions\\r\\nshow that you described your project clearly?

Not only are they on the\\r\\nfront line, furthering your community in the direction of its goals, but they are also your\\r\\nrepresentatives and spokespeople. Although buzz campaigns can be started to attract contributors, this activity should be seen as\\r\\nan always-present and ongoing promotional effort. Your goal here is to constantly\\r\\ncommunicate the positive message of your community, its achievements, and how people can\\r\\nget involved. The greatest communicators of this message are your existing members: you want to turn their\\r\\nsatisfaction into active promotion for your community. To achieve this, your members need\\r\\nto feel proud to be in your community. They should feel a drive and passion for your goals and\\r\\nobjectives, and they should feel that they want to spread the word so that others can enjoy the\\r\\ncommunity, too. A positive community will always generate a positive message and be a\\r\\nmagnet for new contributors. The first step in achieving this is to build a sense of enjoyment, ease of contribution, and pride\\r\\nin your members. You build this by combining the elements discussed in this book: simple\\r\\nprocesses, effective governance, transparency, and so on. When you get these core attributes\\r\\nright, your members will thrive on the opportunities and direction your community offers\\r\\nthem. You now need to encourage them to share their happiness and drive with others. Their own resources and social network are an excellent communication channel for this\\r\\noutreach. Your job is to identify methods via which you can help them use these resources to\\r\\nspread the word about (a) the good work your community performs and (b) why they enjoy\\r\\nbeing part of it. For the former, give them buttons for their websites and blogs. Give them posters to print out\\r\\nand put in libraries, in stores, and on lampposts. Provide them with email signatures that they\\r\\ncan use. Encourage them to set up Facebook/MySpace pages and more. Each of these resources\\r\\nshould direct people back to the community’s website. To encourage your members to share their joy of being a part of the community, the key is\\r\\nthat the communication focuses on the personal story: you need to encourage your members\\r\\nto share what they specifically enjoy about the project.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c3fff38e-cc43-43de-817f-5ca8f9be204e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c3fff38e-cc43-43de-817f-5ca8f9be204e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"BxgdjcBnZmz4itMce2aANzPEF6SzQn1fTw3cL1KHyRE=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"I8qjTkE1jRsgiH55Ye9pgBae45f7Hfw1t0uSzIvIMrg=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"667c1669-9832-4367-b08e-e967b3318842\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"7OoVdA5OjqGcKj1RW6RCABotvdxhaqoOVDjBogqfi4Y=\"}},\"hash\":\"edOpbHF+6niwtgWt77oWxuKePCMrVsNJVaplujbiemA=\",\"text\":\"In doing this you resort to the essence\\r\\nof community that we discussed back at the beginning of the book: stories.

This viral marketing approach to building buzz has become the new way to do business on the\\r\\nInternet. The idea is simple: you build buzz and encourage the consumers of your buzz to also\\r\\nbuild their buzz on the same topic. With this approach, when you unleash something on this\\r\\nnetwork of viral volunteers, it spreads like wildfire. The key here is to have this network\\r\\navailable, and building that network can require a tremendous amount of energy in helping\\r\\npeople to feel engaged, but when they do it will pay dividends in buzz. The key is in making\\r\\npeople feel a sense of empowerment and responsibility to spread the message. BUILDING YOUR BUZZ ARMY\\r\\nAs you grow your community, always be on the lookout for those who have a personality that is\\r\\nattuned to getting people excited about the community and the work it does. While you are taking\\r\\non a responsibility to build buzz, if you can create a team of people who can also build buzz you\\r\\nwill develop a much more scalable resource for building awareness and excitement about your\\r\\ncommunity. People who can build buzz and excitement in a way that is natural and not obnoxious are few and\\r\\nfar between, so keep your eyes open and your ear to the ground for these folks and grab ‘em when\\r\\nyou can. An interesting project that really set the standard for this kind of outreach was the Mozilla\\r\\nFirefox promotional campaign, Spread Firefox. Back in November 2004, the SilverOrange Canadian web firm was commissioned to build\\r\\nMozilla’s website.

Building Alliances\\r\\nGood communication resources and contacts are critical for promotional ideas and concepts to\\r\\nflow from you to the outside world. If you are going to build some great buzz, you need to\\r\\nknow how to communicate effectively in different channels. This requires two skills, which\\r\\nmust be mastered separately for each channel:\\r\\n•   Find the opportunity to make use of that channel. As an example, if you want to be\\r\\nfeatured in a particular magazine, you need to create an opportunity in which you can get\\r\\nyour content there. This almost always involves building contacts. You should get to know\\r\\nthe editors of the magazine and build a relationship that could allow you to feature some\\r\\ncontent in their channel. •   Ensure that your buzz in that channel is appropriate. The norms of communication\\r\\nbetween different mediums vary, but the differences can often be subtle and unwritten. If you act outside the expected boundaries (particularly in volunteer channels), it can\\r\\nimpact negatively on your community. NOTE\\r\\nAlso don’t forget the old saying, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. ” If\\r\\nyou have contacts who can help get your message out there or who can put you in\\r\\ntouch with those who can help, go ahead and ask. Buzz is designed to be consumed by lots of people. You want as much focus and attention on\\r\\nyour community as possible. The more relevant eyeballs there are, the better.

Much of this boils down to readership, and readership varies tremendously. Sometimes you\\r\\ncan ask for this information, such as with magazines, but sometimes it is more of a guess. There\\r\\nwill be some resources that you will assume have a large audience (such as a very popular\\r\\nwebsite) and some not so large (such as a blog). An important consideration in this area is how the growth of the Internet has changed audience\\r\\nfigures.

Advertising opportunities\\r\\nMost publications make a significant chunk of their revenue from advertising, and\\r\\nadvertising does have an impact on content. Although many publications would deny it,\\r\\nadvertising deals are often struck based on relationships between the publication and the\\r\\ncompany. These relationships need to be maintained to continue to bring in revenue. In\\r\\nmany cases the content in a publication may be heavily critical of a company, product, or\\r\\ninitiative. Although this should never matter, for many publications it does, and the\\r\\nproducer of the content is advised to either change the content or focus on other topics. 224   CHAPTER SEVEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9dee2cf7-89b2-48f4-becf-ad39e7bee90b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9dee2cf7-89b2-48f4-becf-ad39e7bee90b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"1RHCZZ6H1ZAmkXPqfU6MwNcLkW9vBapPIDmDZrWcn5w=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"8EKW8K0oldPu61RRNXVKPqWAKTe2exCavK7cyMq7xuE=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b57c7a46-6ccf-47b7-a86b-930b9c1ad46c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"A2yAjZNDkAczQD4Vj5j9hsR3aDxrG8fUs5qvG94WtBM=\"}},\"hash\":\"8mVlvmvVhm66m81Jiu2YaFG3czvYnpQ83UW3qWJA0b4=\",\"text\":\"You should factor these attributes into your plan for building buzz.

It’s not surprising why:\\r\\n•The amateur press has a shared appreciation for volunteer community. They understand\\r\\nyour reasons and intentions and will often want to promote them. •   There is no advertising conflict in most of the amateur press: they can write about\\r\\nwhatever they want. •There is typically no limitation on content. On a blog you can write as many posts as you\\r\\nlike. This opens up more opportunities for you to get in on the content. The most significant mediums in the amateur press arena are blogs, podcasts, and videos. Let’s\\r\\ntake a quick look at all three and explore their cultures. Blogs\\r\\nWeblogs (typically known as blogs) started out life as online diaries. In them people would\\r\\nshare what they were doing, what they were thinking, and what interested them. When\\r\\nblogging started, there were few blogs, and most were devoted to deeply technical topics. Alan Cox was one of the earliest bloggers that I am aware of. Living in Swansea in Wales, Alan\\r\\ndeveloped his celebrity among early Linux fans due to his work on the Linux kernel. Alan\\r\\nworked on incredibly low-level deep and dirty programming. It was about as unrelentingly\\r\\nhardcore as you could get. When I first started reading his diary, I was fascinated. This was not the work of Alan Cox\\r\\ncommunicated through a journalist’s eyes. What I was reading were the direct thoughts of the\\r\\nman himself. Without wishing to sound like an overenthusiastic psychology major, I felt like\\r\\nI was actually closer to the person I was reading about. It gave a direct line to his world, and\\r\\nit pretty much rocked mine. Since then, blogging has expanded somewhat. In addition to blogs being used as personal\\r\\ndiaries, many are now referred to as personal publishing systems. Many people, myself included,\\r\\ninstead use blogs as a means of writing articles that are of interest to them. I use my blog to\\r\\nwrite about community, music, technology, usability, and more.

Although blogging has had a hugely positive impact on how people can articulate\\r\\nand share opinions and perspectives, there has been a dark side. Blogging has also become a\\r\\nmedium in which much overzealous opinion can sometimes be expressed a little too quickly. Unfortunately, I have a rather embarrassing example of someone who fell into this trap: yours\\r\\ntruly. First, a bit of background. There used to be a company called Lindows that made a version of\\r\\nLinux that shared many visual and operational similarities to Windows. Microsoft frowned at\\r\\nthe name “Lindows,” and a fight started between the companies to change the name. Lindows\\r\\ninitially resisted, but after mounting pressure, it changed its name to Linspire. Now to the issue. Let me take the liberty to explain in the words of the article:\\r\\nRecently a chap named Andrew Betts decided to take the non-free elements out of Linspire and\\r\\nrelease the free parts as another Linspire-derived distribution called Freespire. This act of\\r\\nrereleasing distributions or code is certainly nothing new and is fully within the ethos of open\\r\\nsource. In fact, many of the distributions we use today were derived from existing tools. Unfortunately, Linspire saw this as a problem and asked for the Freespire name to be changed. Reading through the notice of the change, the language and flow of the words screams marketing\\r\\nto me. I am certainly not insinuating that Betts has been forced into writing the page, or that\\r\\nthe Linspire marketing drones have written it and appended his name, but it certainly doesn’t\\r\\nsound quite right to me. I would have expected something along the lines of “Freespire has been\\r\\nchanged to Squiggle to avoid confusion with the Linspire product”, but this is not the case. Instead we are treated to choice marketing cuts such as “To help alleviate any confusion, I\\r\\ncontacted Linspire and they made an extremely generous offer to us all”. Wow. What is this\\r\\none-chance-in-a-lifetime-not-sold-in-stores offer? Luckily, he continues, “they want everyone\\r\\nwho has been following my project to experience ‘the real’ Linspire, FOR FREE!!!”.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1b11d87f-e9f2-4c85-8f5c-ac3827848e43":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1b11d87f-e9f2-4c85-8f5c-ac3827848e43\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"bRCE888R6vqImkkLnwdS7Q6jXlzKFOY1gNjIlwc9OAg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"5M/w/YfE+CD8J1+egFofenIJRuWAIxv2QPad5RbvlU4=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"617faf66-8832-4b8f-98cc-f6b7a80d0054\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"D2PiuaCsBvUl/4c7n1LNAokQTDjHOONNoyroTxfiFVE=\"}},\"hash\":\"3N8ZoNRDBYYFofabF7/9UpOhRLJO5qr+fsT6JMaFW7M=\",\"text\":\"Now, pray\\r\\ntell, how do we get this “real” version of the software “FOR FREE!!!”? “For a limited time, they are making available a coupon code called ‘FREESPIRE’ that will\\r\\ngive you a free digital copy of Linspire!

PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH\\r\\nIn this chapter we have discussed the important attributes in setting up a website and blog for your\\r\\nproject, and also how to build buzz using other people’s blogs. Importantly, you personally should have a blog. Use it as an opportunity to discuss your personal\\r\\ninterests and to talk about your community. Podcasts\\r\\nPodcasts are audio shows that are distributed on the Internet. They typically have between one\\r\\nand four presenters, and they are often based on fairly specific topics. Many listeners use a\\r\\nspecial piece of software called a podcatcher to subscribe to a podcast so that when new episodes\\r\\nof a podcast are released, they are automatically downloaded to a media player such as an iPod. This is a fantastic way to keep listeners updated with new content. A significant reason behind the success of podcasts is that they deliver interesting specialist\\r\\ncontent to the listener to fill those dull minutes while traveling to work. Many podcasts include\\r\\ninterviews, reviews, features, debates, and other content. They vary hugely in both audio and\\r\\ncontent quality, and some podcasts have netted thousands of listeners. As I mentioned earlier in this book, I cofounded a podcast with some friends called LugRadio. The show was very specifically focused on open source and digital rights. It took a lighthearted\\r\\nand irreverent approach to the content, and we deliberately focused on making the content\\r\\nsocial, fun, and amusing. Each show presented a range of topics for discussion, and each of us\\r\\nwould weigh in and share our thoughts, often resulting in raucous debate and discussion. Podcasts are always looking for pointers to interesting content and announcements. You\\r\\nshould email the presenters and explain what you are working on, and see if they would be\\r\\ninterested in featuring your community on the show. If you manage to get a spot on a popular\\r\\npodcast, it could bring a wealth of new blood to your community. Although you may feel a\\r\\nlittle funny about emailing the presenters out of the blue, go ahead! If you don’t ask, you\\r\\ndon’t get.

Finally, always ensure that you have a web address to point the listeners to. This will provide\\r\\nan option to feed them more information, and the link can be listed in the podcast’s show\\r\\nnotes. Ensure that the website the link points to is packed with content that’s ready when the\\r\\nepisode of the podcast is published. NOTE\\r\\nAs a gesture to the makers of the podcast, it is highly recommended that you spread\\r\\nthe word about the podcast episode that your community is featured in. You could\\r\\ndo this on your website, in your community’s communication channels, and on\\r\\nblogs.

Videos\\r\\nOnline video has become increasingly popular as the Internet has become faster and more\\r\\naccessible. Although a hefty Internet connection is required to suck said videos down onto\\r\\nyour computer for viewing, the sheer popularity of services such as YouTube and blip.tv has\\r\\ndemonstrated that many do indulge in such audiovisual delights on the Internet. While some of us may reminisce about the dark days of dial-up Internet access, it is important\\r\\nto remember that many parts of the world still rely on slower dial-up connections.

As\\r\\nan example, if you are reaching out to a community in a remote part of Africa, you may want\\r\\nto rely on another lower-bandwidth medium.

Another hugely useful feature of YouTube are channels. These are home pages on YouTube\\r\\nthat contain videos from a certain provider (such as an artist, actor, or your community). There\\r\\nare different types of channels on YouTube designed for different types of providers that have\\r\\nadditional facilities such as custom logos, blog entries, and tour dates. A huge benefit of a\\r\\nchannel is that people can subscribe to it and will be notified when you add a new video. This\\r\\nis an excellent way to keep people hooked into your videos. YouTube channels are something we have used extensively in the Ubuntu community. As\\r\\npart of our ongoing efforts to educate and train developers in how to contribute to Ubuntu,\\r\\nwe created the Ubuntu Developer Channel on YouTube. On the site, we uploaded tuition\\r\\nvideos, developer interviews, and more.

Another interesting option for video is live streaming. This is where you produce a live\\r\\nvideocast that people can view as it is being recorded at a scheduled time.

Whether you make use of prerecorded or live video, there are some nuggets of best practice\\r\\nthat are useful to keep your viewers engaged in your content:\\r\\n•Do your best to keep production values high. As an example, if you are recording the video\\r\\nwith your laptop’s webcam, consider buying an external microphone. Many of the built-\\r\\nin mics in laptops sound awful and distort easily. Ensure that the location the camera\\r\\npoints at looks clean, uncluttered, and professional, and wear clothes that don’t distract\\r\\nthe viewer. •Before you produce your video, make some notes about what you will discuss. The easiest\\r\\nway do this is to make a series of bullet points with the topics you want to feature. If you\\r\\nare nervous, you may want to write a script, but I highly recommend that you don’t. Unscripted content that is delivered well is far more natural and engaging. •   If possible, have more than one presenter.

Events and Conferences\\r\\nEvents and conferences can be really valuable targets for growing buzz and excitement about\\r\\nyour community. Depending on what kind of community you are part of, there are often\\r\\nevents happening locally and farther afield that are related to your community and the wider\\r\\ntopic your community is interested in. As an example, from my career, open source has taken\\r\\nme to events all over the world, ranging from formal business conventions to open source and\\r\\nscience fiction crossover events (and believe me, the latter is to be seen to be believed). Aside from being useful, events are just a whole lot of fun, too. You get to meet interesting\\r\\npeople, further your community, and maybe even see a new part of the world. Many of us\\r\\nlove to travel, so it makes perfect sense to get out there on the road and not only further your\\r\\ncommunity, but also have a great time doing it. Unfortunately, this fun comes at a cost. While online buzz building is pretty cost-effective,\\r\\ngoing to events can get expensive, particularly if you don’t have a company paying for it. Conference tickets, hotel rooms, plane tickets, food and drinks, and other costs all add up. Before you know it, that $50 conference ticket can easily balloon to $500 or more when you\\r\\nadd in all the other costs of getting there and back home. Things can also get pretty costly when\\r\\nyou are surrounded by many people who are there courtesy of their company and you need\\r\\nto pay out of your own pocket to join them at nice restaurants, bars, lunch spots, and more.

Choosing Events\\r\\nIn 2011 I moved a member of my team to focus on a different kind of community. Traditionally,\\r\\nJorge had been coordinating relationships with other open source projects and how they\\r\\ninterfaced with Ubuntu, but there was an increased focus on a new Ubuntu technology called\\r\\nJuju. We wanted to build some community growth and outreach around it, and with this in\\r\\nmind I moved Jorge into a new position as our cloud community liaison. Part of this role was going to involve getting Jorge out to events to speak about Juju, explain\\r\\nwhat it is, how it works, how to use it, and how attendees of those events can create Charms\\r\\n(technical contributions that make different cloud services work with Juju). With this change I was first faced with a resourcing challenge. At the time, the cloud was an\\r\\nincredibly hot technology and there were literally hundreds of events happening every year\\r\\nin the cloud space. Obviously we could not send Jorge to them all; even if we had the travel\\r\\nresources to send him, we would break his gentle soul with such a brutal and constant stream\\r\\nof airplanes, hotels, and those small bags of peanuts airline staff give you. As such, we needed\\r\\nto pick which events we wanted him to attend, and pick wisely. With this in mind I asked Jorge to put together a spreadsheet that listed all the events that\\r\\ncould be interesting for us to attend. The focus of this list was clear: these need to be cloud\\r\\nevents and oriented around technology (as opposed to business events) and DevOps (the\\r\\naudience we were focusing on). I asked Jorge to gather this list of events and to determine the\\r\\nfollowing characteristics for each one:\\r\\n•   Location and venue\\r\\n•   Date(s) of the event\\r\\n•   Typical attendance size\\r\\n•   Number of sessions and average talk audience size\\r\\n•   Team priority\\r\\nEach of these pieces of information helped to provide an overview of each event and its\\r\\nrespective details.

As an example, the value derived from a local book club attending an event could be getting more\\r\\nmembers involved and more books donated. As such, the level of financial investment in attending\\r\\nthe event would need to be low due to the grassroots nature of the group.

I had no idea what a\\r\\npresentation was supposed to look like; it wasn’t like there was a YouTube back then where I\\r\\ncould pick up tips...hell, there was barely even an Internet. Somewhat limited in options, I asked my dad for help. A man of many vocations (who should\\r\\nreally have a book written about him), he was currently working in a senior role at a large car\\r\\nsales organization.

We have all sat through dry, boring, monotonous\\r\\ntalks, and many of you will have seen fun, interesting, and vibrant talks. What is also important in delivering a great presentation is creating slides that support what\\r\\nyou are saying effectively. Unfortunately, over the years many presenters have treated their\\r\\nslides almost like an entirely different entity to the content they are talking about. Remember,\\r\\nthough, that the purpose of the slides is to visualize and simplify the understanding of the\\r\\ncontent you are discussing. In other words, what you say and the slides you show should knit\\r\\ntogether like those mittens your grandma used to give you when you were six years old and\\r\\nhad a bowl haircut. As we discussed earlier, your presentation should tell a story, and your slides should be used\\r\\nlike the pictures in a storybook to outline and illustrate your story as it progresses. Unfortunately, some presenters only ever illustrate their presentations with diagrams,\\r\\noverlapping circles, bar charts, and other output from the yawn factory. Everyone has her own slide design style, but I want to recommend an approach that I strongly\\r\\nsuggest you all use. Here it is...get ready for it and fasten your seatbelts:\\r\\nYour slides can only contain either (1) a picture, or (2) no more than 10 words. The world has seen enough slides filled with bullet points, overly complex diagrams, arrows,\\r\\noverlapping circles, hundreds of logos, and other presentation horrors. As you can see with one of my slides, shown in Figure 7-2, I prefer to use only a few words or\\r\\njust an image; it makes the slide less distracting and more visually interesting. Keep your slides simple and use them as a means to offer a visual cue to indicate where you\\r\\nare in the story. It will distract your audience less (they can’t read all those bullets and listen\\r\\nto what you are saying at the same time), it will look attractive, and it will just result in a more\\r\\ninteresting experience.

First, my presentation style has always been story-oriented; I build up a context, provide some\\r\\ntension in that context, and then deliver an outcome that strives to relieve the tension and\\r\\nprovide insight. As such, there is a certain amount of setup and context building that gets the\\r\\naudience up the curve; then I deliver the outcome and bring the audience back down over the\\r\\ncurve and provide conclusions. This storytelling component takes time...valuable time in a\\r\\nshort presentation. Second, Steph Walli (a friend of mine and proofreader of the first edition of this book) observed\\r\\nthat while there is a very real skill in writing novels, there is also a real but very different skill\\r\\nin writing short stories.

Our strategic plan has helped us lay out a blueprint for what our community can achieve. But\\r\\na plan is just that: a plan. It is a statement of work that we intend to do. It is not enough to\\r\\nsimply provide your community with a strategic plan, even if it was collaboratively produced.

If they had their way, they would ask you to do it for them. In the absence of\\r\\ndelegation they instead want you to advise, make decisions, and generally think for them. I am a fan of neither cocky nor procrastinating people. I am, however, a huge fan of the third\\r\\ncategory of people: those who are confident in their approach, but who reinforce and improve\\r\\nsaid approach with feedback, mentoring, and guidance.

We want our measurements to feed into our interpretations of what\\r\\nwe’re doing and to trigger changes that can further improve our work. Unfortunately, many community leaders obsess a little too much over the act of gathering\\r\\ninformation as opposed to gathering meaningful information. The goal here is not to construct\\r\\nan enormous vacuum cleaner to suck every tiny detail of your community into a graph. The\\r\\ngoal is instead to identify what we don’t know about our community and to use measurements\\r\\nas a means to understand those things better. Measurements without meaning are simply annoying. Randomly sucking in statistics is\\r\\nintensely time-consuming—not only for you, but also for the people who provide you with\\r\\nthe input. Most of us reading this book will be building volunteer communities in which time\\r\\nis a precious substance. Don’t waste it. Each time you engage with your contributors to gather feedback, there is an unwritten yet\\r\\nimplicit social contract: as a result of the feedback they expect change—hopefully positive\\r\\nchange. When positive change does not happen, frustration sets in. If your measurements have\\r\\npurpose and you are willing to make a change based on those measurements, your community\\r\\nwill be satisfied. Defining Purpose\\r\\nEarlier in this book we constructed our strategic plan, which included a vocabulary identifying\\r\\nthe key features of our strategy. Let’s have a quick recap:\\r\\n•   We first created a mission statement that outlined the broad aims of the community. •   Based on this statement we produced a set of high-level objectives. These are the major\\r\\nachievements that together form our mission statement. •For each objective we have a set of goals. Each goal is a near-term outcome that we want\\r\\nto achieve.

Hooks ’n’ Data\\r\\nSo far we’ve discussed the importance of gathering feedback and measurements from our\\r\\ncommunity, and that the focal point is the goals we decided on in our strategic plan. The next\\r\\nstep is to build into each goal a feedback loop that can deliver information about our progress\\r\\non the goal. This feedback loop is composed of two components—hooks and data:\\r\\nHooks\\r\\nA hook is a medium or resource in which we can slurp out useful information about our\\r\\ngoal. As an example, if our goal was to reduce crime in a neighborhood, a hook could be\\r\\nlocal crime reports from the police. The reason I call them hooks is that they are the\\r\\nprotruding access points in which we can display interesting information. 248   CHAPTER EIGHT\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"4c75a4c8-b9d0-4d0d-af3e-94ca2424861a":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"4c75a4c8-b9d0-4d0d-af3e-94ca2424861a\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"5bp58WeooKMLuBtN/FaDLTTLn0fkTeqIDs022nTiibg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"lUtQR+s2UXMNaezBZ9c1UE2qhkDMBZ0ZlMCEkw2s7as=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"6e621241-3998-45d0-a41e-78a1f8e557c2\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"wea2Q/lbU97I7o4WiRA29Rt3xnPpGFOM0RqREe34g8Y=\"}},\"hash\":\"e7DY76zRp27+wEsYrEu/hpig0XQIBMZ6mXofuCyZBe8=\",\"text\":\"Data\\r\\nIf a hook is the medium that provides useful information, data is the information itself. Using our previous example of a goal to reduce crime in a neighborhood, the hook (local\\r\\ncrime reports) could provide data such as “10 crimes this month. ” The data is composed\\r\\nof two attributes, the data itself and the measurement unit. Again, the kind of unit can be\\r\\nused to feed a display (e.g., numerical units are great for graphs). To help understand this further, let’s look at an example. In the Ubuntu community, my team\\r\\nhas worked to help increase the number of people who become new developers. In our strategic\\r\\nplan we created an objective to increase the number of community developers and fleshed it\\r\\nout with goals for improving developer documentation, awareness, and education. Each goal\\r\\nhad the expected set of actions. For us to effectively track progress on the objective, we needed\\r\\ndata about developer growth. Fortunately, we have access to a system called Launchpad, which is where all Ubuntu\\r\\ndevelopers do their work. This system was an enormous hook that we could use to extract\\r\\ndata. To do this we gathered a range of data types:\\r\\n•   The current number of developers (e.g., 50 developers)\\r\\n•How long new contributions from prospective developers took to be mentored by existing\\r\\ndevelopers (e.g., 1.4 weeks)\\r\\n•   How many of these new contributions are outstanding for mentoring (e.g., 23\\r\\ncontributions)\\r\\nLaunchpad had all of this information available. Using some computer programs created by\\r\\nDaniel Holbach, we could extract the data. This allowed us to track not only the current number\\r\\nof developers, but also how quickly progress was being made: we knew that if the number of\\r\\ndevelopers was regularly growing, we were making progress. We could also use this data to assess the primary tool that new developers use to participate\\r\\nin Ubuntu: the queue of new contributions to be mentored. When a new developer wants to\\r\\ncontribute, she adds her contribution to this queue. Our existing developers then review the\\r\\nitem, provide feedback, and if it is suitable, commit it. By having data on the average time something sits on that queue as well as the number of\\r\\noutstanding items, we could (a) set reasonable expectations and (b) ensure that the facility was\\r\\nworking as well as possible.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6e621241-3998-45d0-a41e-78a1f8e557c2":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6e621241-3998-45d0-a41e-78a1f8e557c2\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"5bp58WeooKMLuBtN/FaDLTTLn0fkTeqIDs022nTiibg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"lUtQR+s2UXMNaezBZ9c1UE2qhkDMBZ0ZlMCEkw2s7as=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4c75a4c8-b9d0-4d0d-af3e-94ca2424861a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"e7DY76zRp27+wEsYrEu/hpig0XQIBMZ6mXofuCyZBe8=\"}},\"hash\":\"wea2Q/lbU97I7o4WiRA29Rt3xnPpGFOM0RqREe34g8Y=\",\"text\":\"In this example, Launchpad was a hook.

The problem with the general presentation of statistics is that the\\r\\nnumbers are often used to make the point itself instead of being an indicator of a wider\\r\\nconclusion. Statistics are merely indicators. They are the metaphorical equivalent of the numbers and\\r\\ngauges on the dashboard of a car. No single reading can advise on the health of the car; the\\r\\ngauges, along with the sound of the car itself, how it handles, its look and feel, and the smell\\r\\nof burning oil all combine to give you an indication that your beloved motor may be under\\r\\nthe weather.

For us to get the most out of statistics, we need to understand the mechanics of our community\\r\\nand which hooks can deliver data from those mechanics. We will discuss how to find hooks\\r\\nfrom these mechanics later in this chapter. The risks of interpretation\\r\\nAlthough statistics can provide compelling documentation of the current status quo of your\\r\\ncommunity, they require skill to be interpreted properly. A great example of this is forum posts. Many online communities use discussion forums, the online message boards in which you can\\r\\npost messages to a common topic (known in forum parlance as a thread). Within most forums\\r\\nthere is one statistic that everyone seems to have something of a love affair with: the total\\r\\nnumber of posts made by each user. It’s easy to see how people draw this conclusion. If you have three users, one with 2 posts, one\\r\\nwith 200 posts, and one with 2,000 posts, it’s tempting to believe the user with 2,000 posts has\\r\\nmore insight, experience, and wisdom. Many forums latch onto this perspective and provide\\r\\nlabels based on the number of posts. As an example, a forum could have these labels:\\r\\n0–100 posts: New to the Forum\\r\\n101–500 posts: On the Road to Greatness\\r\\n501–1,500 posts: Regular Hero\\r\\n1,501–3,000 posts: Dependable Legend\\r\\n3,001+ posts: Expert Ninja\\r\\nAs an example, if I had 493 posts, this would give me the “On the Road to Greatness” label,\\r\\nbut if I had 2,101 posts, I would have the “Dependable Legend” label. These labels and the\\r\\nnumber of posts statistic are great for pumping up the members, but they offer little insight in\\r\\nterms of quality.

Earlier\\r\\nwe talked about a project to increase the number of community developers in Ubuntu, and\\r\\none piece of data we gathered was the current number of community developers who had\\r\\nbeen approved. This is, of course, a useful piece of information, and as the number climbs it\\r\\nhelps indicate that we are achieving our goal. What that single number does not teach us,\\r\\nthough, is how quickly we are achieving our goal. Imagine that we had 50 developers right now and we wanted to increase that figure by 20%\\r\\na year.

If we want to encourage this consistency\\r\\nof growth, we need not only to look at the number of current developers once, but also to track\\r\\nit over time so that we can see if we are on track to achieve our 20% target. Using this example\\r\\nin the Ubuntu world, we could use Launchpad to take a regular snapshot of the number of\\r\\ncurrent developers, plot it on a graph, and draw a line between the dots.

I have used surveys extensively in my\\r\\ncareer, and each time they have provided me and my teams with excellent feedback. Over the\\r\\nnext few pages I want to share some of the experience I have picked up in delivering effective\\r\\nsurveys. The first step is to determine the purpose of the survey. What do you want to achieve with it? What do you need to know? Every survey needs to have a purpose, and it is this purpose that\\r\\nwill help you craft a useful set of questions that should generate an even more useful set of data. NOTE\\r\\nYou should avoid surveys just for the purpose of creating a survey. Only ever create\\r\\na survey if there is a question in your head that is unanswered. Surveys are tools\\r\\nto help you understand your community better: use them only when there is a\\r\\npurpose. Examples of this could include understanding the perception of a specific\\r\\nprocess, identifying common patterns in behavior in communication channels, and\\r\\nlearning which resources are used more than others. Again, your goals from your strategic plan are a key source of purpose for your surveys. As an\\r\\nexample, if your goal is “increase the number of contributors in the community,” you should\\r\\nbreak down the workflow of how people join your community, and produce a set of questions\\r\\nthat test each step in this workflow.

As such, I recommend that you use no more than 10 questions. This will\\r\\ngive the respondent an average of 30 seconds to answer each question.

Most\\r\\nof you will be familiar with these: you are provided with a satisfaction scale between 1 (awful)\\r\\nand 5 (excellent), and are then expected to select the appropriate satisfaction grade for that\\r\\nquestion. Surveys like this are simple and effective. THE VARIANCE OF THE VOTE\\r\\nRatings are a funny beast, and everyone interprets them differently. A great example of this is the employee performance review that so many of us are familiar with. In\\r\\none organization I worked at, the scale ranged from 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (outstanding). I did a small\\r\\nstraw poll of how different people interpreted the grading system, and the views varied\\r\\ntremendously:\\r\\n• Some felt that if 1 is unacceptable and 5 is outstanding, 3 would be considered acceptable,\\r\\nand if staff members completed their work as contractually expected, a 3 would be a\\r\\nreasonable score. • Others felt that meeting contractually agreed-upon standards would merit a 5 on the scale,\\r\\nand that 3 would indicate significant, if tolerable, lapses. • Interestingly, some people informed me that they would never provide a 5, as they felt there\\r\\nwas always room for improvement. When people fill in your survey, you will get an equally varied set of expectations around the ratings. You should factor this variation of responses into your assessment of the results. One way to do this\\r\\nis to add up the responses from each person and increase or reduce them proportionally so that\\r\\neach person’s total adds up to the same points.

I was\\r\\nspecifically keen to learn if there were any quirks in the process that we could ease. If we could\\r\\nflatten out the process a little, we could make it easier for the community to participate. To do this, we sat down and watched a contributor working with bugs.

This data gave us a solid idea of areas of redundancy in how he interacted with a\\r\\ncommunity facility. What Jorge on my team did here was user-based testing, more commonly known as usability\\r\\ntesting. This is a user-centered design method that helps developers evaluate software by having\\r\\nreal people use it and provide feedback. By simply sitting a few people in front of your software\\r\\nand having them try it out, you can obtain valuable feedback for a design before too much is\\r\\ninvested in coding a bad solution. Usability testing is important for two reasons. The most obvious is that it gets us feedback from\\r\\na lot of real users, all doing the same thing. Even though we aren’t necessarily looking for\\r\\nstatistical significance, recognizing usage patterns can help the designer or developer begin to\\r\\nthink about how to solve the problem in a more usable way. The second reason is that usability testing, when done early in the development cycle, can save\\r\\na lot of community resources. Catching usability problems in the design phase can save\\r\\ndevelopment time normally lost to rewriting a bad component. Catching usability problems\\r\\nearly in a release cycle can preempt bug submissions and save time triaging. This is on top of\\r\\nthe added benefit that many users may never experience such usability issues because they\\r\\nare caught and fixed so early. Open source is a naturally user-centered community. We rely on user feedback to help test\\r\\nsoftware and influence future development directions.

Throughout my career in open source, I have run a number of usability tests, and not all have been\\r\\nthe conventional laboratory-based testing you often think of when you hear “usability test. ” These\\r\\nthree examples help describe the different ways usability testing can be conducted and how it can\\r\\nfit into the open source community. My first example is the usability testing of the Kubuntu version of Ubiquity, the Ubuntu installer. This usability test was organized as a graduate class activity at the University of Baltimore. I worked\\r\\nwith the students to design a research plan, recruit participants, run the test, and analyze the results. Finally, all of the project reports were collated into a single report, which was presented to the\\r\\nUbuntu community. The timing of the test was aligned with a recent release and development summit,\\r\\nand so even though the logistics of the usability test spanned several weeks, the results provided to\\r\\nthe Ubuntu community were timely and relevant. Although this is the more rare case of how to organize open source usability testing, involving\\r\\nuniversity students in open source usability testing provides three key benefits. The open source\\r\\nproject benefits from a more formal usability test, which is otherwise difficult to obtain; the university\\r\\nstudents get experience testing a real product, which looks good on a curriculum vitae; and the\\r\\nuniversity students get exposure to open source, which could potentially lead to interest in further\\r\\ncontribution in the future. My second example involves guerilla-style usability testing over IRC. I was working with\\r\\nKonstantinos Smanis on the design and development of KGRUBEditor. Unlike most software, which\\r\\nusually is in the maintenance phase, we had the opportunity to design the application from scratch. While we were designing certain interactive components, we were unsure which of the two design\\r\\noptions was the most intuitive. Konstantinos coded and packaged dummy prototypes of the two\\r\\ninteractive methods while I recruited and interviewed several people on IRC, guiding them through\\r\\nthe test scenario and recording their actions and feedback. The results we gathered from the\\r\\nimpromptu testing helped us make a decision about which design to use.

Although Celeste was largely testing end-user software, her approach was very community-\\r\\nfocused. The heart of her approach involved community collaboration, not only to highlight\\r\\nproblems in the interface but also to identify better ways to approach the same task. These same tests should be made against your own community facilities. Consider some of the\\r\\nfollowing topics for these kinds of observational tests:\\r\\n•   Ask a member to find something on your website. •   Ask a prospective contributor to join the community and find the resources he needs. •   Ask a member to find a piece of information, such as a bug, a message on a mailing list,\\r\\nor another resource. •   Ask a member to escalate an issue to a governance council.

With this data\\r\\nwe can then make improvements to optimize the flow of conversation. Let’s look at our example of bugs to illustrate this. Every bug has a lifeline, and that lifeline is broadly divided into three areas: reporting,\\r\\ntriaging, and fixing. Each area has a series of steps involved. Let’s look at reporting as an\\r\\nexample. These are the steps:\\r\\n1. The user experiences a problem with a piece of software. 2. The user visits a bug tracker in her web browser to report that problem. 3. The user enters several pieces of information: a summary, description, name of the\\r\\nsoftware product, and other criteria. 4. When the bug is filed, the user can subscribe to the bug report and be notified of the\\r\\nchanges to the bug. Now let’s look at each step again, see which hooks are available, and identify what data we\\r\\ncould pull out:\\r\\n1. There are no hooks in this step. 2. When the user visits the bug tracker in her web browser, the bug tracker could provide\\r\\ndata about the number of visitors, what browsers they are using, which operating systems\\r\\nthey are on, and other web statistics. 3. We could query the bug tracker for anything that is present in a bug report: how many\\r\\nbugs are in the tracker, how many bugs are in each product, how many bugs are new, and\\r\\nso on. 4.We could gather statistics about the number of subscribers for each and which bugs have\\r\\nthe most subscribers. So there’s a huge range of possible hooks in just the bug reporting part of the bug conveyor\\r\\nbelt. Let’s now follow the example through with the remaining two areas and their steps and\\r\\nhooks. The following are the triaging steps:\\r\\n1. A triager looks at a bug and changes the bug status. 2. The triager may need to ask for additional information about the bug. 3. Other triagers add their comments and additional information to help identify the cause\\r\\nof the bug.

When you walk into a room and your nose tells you something, your\\r\\nears tell you something, and your eyes tell still more, your brain puts the evidence together to\\r\\nproduce a perception. Perception occurs in community, too, but instead of physical senses providing the evidence,\\r\\nthe day-to-day happenings of the community provide the input. When this evidence is\\r\\ngathered together, it can have a dramatic impact on how engaged and enabled people feel in\\r\\nthat community.

Liebling invited staff members and\\r\\nprisoners to reflect on their best rather than worst experiences and identified broad agreement\\r\\nbetween both groups on “what matters” in prison life.

Measuring perception involves two focus points. On the one hand you want to understand the\\r\\nperception of the people inside your community, but on the other hand you also want to\\r\\nexplore the perception of your community from the outside. This is particularly important for\\r\\nattracting new contributors. To measure both kinds of perception, our hooks are people, and we need to have a series of\\r\\nconversations with different people inside and outside our projects to really understand how\\r\\nthey feel. As an example, imagine you are a small software project and you have a development\\r\\nteam, a documentation team, and a user community. You should spend some time having a\\r\\nsocial chitchat with a few members in each team. This will help paint a picture for you. Some of the most valuable feedback about perception can happen with so-called “corridor\\r\\nconversations. ” These are informal, social, ad hoc conversations that often occur in bars,\\r\\nrestaurants, and the corridors of conferences. These conversations typically have no agenda,\\r\\nthere are no meeting notes, and they are not recorded. The informal nature of the conversation\\r\\nhelps the community member to relax and share her thoughts with you. Perception of you\\r\\nAnother important measurement criterion is the perception of you as a person. As a leader\\r\\nyou are there to work with and represent your community. Your community will have a\\r\\nperception of you that will be shared with its members. You want to understand that perception\\r\\nand ensure that it fairly reflects your efforts. Perception of community leaders is complex, particularly when a leader works for a company\\r\\nto lead the community. As an example, as part of my current role at Canonical as the Ubuntu\\r\\ncommunity manager I work extensively with our community in public, running public\\r\\nprojects. There are, however, some internal activities that I focus on. I help the wider company\\r\\nwork with the community.

TRANSPARENCY IN PERSONAL FEEDBACK\\r\\nIn the continuing interest of building transparency, an excellent method is to be entirely public in\\r\\nletting your community share their feedback about you. As an example, you could write a blog entry asking for feedback and encouraging people to leave\\r\\ncomments on the entry, and allow anonymous comments. This is a tremendously open gesture toward your community. It could also be viewed as a\\r\\ntremendously risky gesture. There is a reasonable likelihood that someone could share some\\r\\nnegative thoughts about you there, and others may agree. (But that’s also feedback you need to\\r\\ncollect! )\\r\\nAnonymity and Privacy\\r\\nThe act of measuring community is an exercise in gathering information about other people\\r\\nand drawing conclusions. Some of this data will be generic to the community as a whole (such\\r\\nas statistics about mailing lists or forums) and some will be specific to an individual (such as a\\r\\nresponse to a survey). When data can be directly linked to an individual, the subject of\\r\\nanonymity and privacy steps into view. Although at first these two topics may seem like they\\r\\ncould potentially cause problems if you put your foot down wrong, their guidelines are simple. Let’s talk about them both now. Anonymity\\r\\nAnonymity is a valuable tool when gathering feedback, especially around contentious topics. If you are gathering feedback about a particular governance body in your community, many\\r\\npeople may feel uncomfortable associating their views with their identity. For this reason,\\r\\nanonymous feedback can be a useful option. There is a dark side to anonymity, though. The Internet has long proved that when identity\\r\\ncan be hidden or obscured, all manner of whack jobs and nutcases want to be your friends or,\\r\\nrather, your enemies.

Anonymity creates two major risks. First, when identity is hidden, some jump at the\\r\\nopportunity to be rude, arrogant, and sometimes outright offensive. These people are often\\r\\nreferred to as trolls in online communities. The second, subtler problem is that anonymity will\\r\\nsometimes cause people to overstate their concern with an issue: they will often dial up the\\r\\nannoyance factor to 11. This means you get a misrepresented perspective, and this can skew\\r\\nyour aim of getting genuinely representative views from the community. With this we have a difficult balance: there is value in anonymous feedback, but there is a\\r\\nsignificant risk of trolling and overstated unrepresentative perspectives. How do we find a\\r\\nbalance? A simple solution is to welcome anonymous data, but be cognizant of what it could\\r\\nrepresent. Therefore, when conducting your research, you should encourage a combination\\r\\nof feedback with identity attached in addition to anonymous feedback. Consider the example of running a survey to assess the quality of experience of a contributor\\r\\njoining your community. I recommend that you have two identical surveys: one directed to\\r\\nthe 10 most recent people who have joined your community, and the other open to anyone. When evaluating the results, treat the survey that you directed to particular people as the most\\r\\nvaluable input, but still consider highly the results of your other survey. Combining the results\\r\\nof both surveys is likely to produce a balanced perspective. Before we move on, I want to dispel the myth of anonymity on the Internet. This all boils down\\r\\nto a simple rule:\\r\\nNo one is anonymous on the Internet. No one. (Yes, that includes you super-elite hacker types, too. )\\r\\nIn the online world it’s tempting to believe you are anonymous, but so-called “anonymity” is\\r\\nmerely a carefully constructed set of abstractions that ultimately puts most people off trying to\\r\\ndiscover your identity.

Coming from a journalism and consultancy background, I never set out\\r\\nto be a community manager. No one did. Like many, I ended up falling into community\\r\\nmanagement basically by talking myself into it and getting lucky. On the morning of my first day on the job, I made a cup of PG Tips tea, sat down at my laptop,\\r\\nand logged on. Two weeks later, when I was done jumping up and down while high on the\\r\\nfumes of landing the new gig, said new deal had become very real very quickly. Surrounded\\r\\nby my heroes and directly working for the founder of Ubuntu, I started to feel the crushing\\r\\nsense of responsibility for what I had taken on. Erk. I had asked for this job because, in my mind, Ubuntu was (and still is) critical to the success of\\r\\nbringing Free Software, openness, and choice to technology. I saw it as a vehicle for change,\\r\\nand the only way to keep that vehicle moving forward was to grow, excite, and motivate a\\r\\ncommunity. My passion for being the guy who helps make that happen got me through the\\r\\ninterviews and kept my nerves under control, but now my nerves were dining out on paranoia. If I was going to be on the hook for driving this vehicle, which direction was I going to take\\r\\nit in? 269\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9ad9ff55-5839-488a-961c-4c0281d0a02b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9ad9ff55-5839-488a-961c-4c0281d0a02b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"r3z93NnZbJAxqEJE/NZCWhUZHiyuiefMf6df8Q5w5Wk=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"huwCyGHdA2mUZ8h0Posc6yvTRcTFoxf3qnjy2ZUxbwU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"3c39cafb-3dce-49c7-9766-5d8084ad5d9a\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"/5B7mT1Gf/Hk3HNqhBb2onTzx8DrCYJ3/xtlZDKFbaE=\"}},\"hash\":\"4r5x6JxqM2jEqYLBQk1jHo7f5MmW358o14iIBO2iDHA=\",\"text\":\"Credibility and the Need to Track Progress\\r\\nAside from working with my heroes, reporting to one of the most well-known people in open\\r\\nsource, and not knowing exactly where to start, I faced one other glorious wrinkle in the cheek\\r\\nof my new job: limited credibility. Credibility is the respect you earn from different stakeholders, be they community members,\\r\\nmanagement, founders, press, or others. Gaining credibility is critical if you want to be\\r\\nsuccessful. Consequently, a lack of credibility can be rather damning. Unfortunately, today gaining credibility is a challenge for community managers. The profession\\r\\nof community management is still very young, and as it continues to evolve, we are surrounded\\r\\nby those who don’t understand what we do, express cynicism about what we can achieve, or\\r\\nchoose to assume we’re doing something entirely different from the reality, and likely far less\\r\\nflattering. I am sure some of you have heard the ol’ chestnut of “Oh, you folks just write blog\\r\\nentries all day and spew out headlines to nerds on Twitter, right? ”\\r\\nWhen I started in my new job, I did have some credibility, but it was in a more general, transient\\r\\nsense. I had been writing for years about open source and technology and talking about it on\\r\\nLugRadio, and one of the small perks of such ramblings was that some people remembered my\\r\\nname from my articles, blogs, and podcasts. While this boosted my ego as an opinionated and\\r\\nhungry young journalist, none of that mattered a dime when I started as the Ubuntu\\r\\ncommunity manager. I had limited credibility in the Ubuntu community outside of the faint\\r\\nflickers of a reputation in the wider yet tiny open source fishbowl. It wasn’t that I had negativity stapled to my reputation; but credibility is context-sensitive and\\r\\nmy name just didn’t resonate with the wider Ubuntu community. Ubuntu is a meritocracy and\\r\\nit thrives on rewarding those who add significant and sustained contributions with the respect\\r\\nthey deserve. Now look at what happened: here was this English guy, with few direct\\r\\ncontributions to Ubuntu and a new job title of “Ubuntu community manager,” who was tasked\\r\\nwith growing and optimizing the community.

The project had big\\r\\nideas and was not just planning to create a Free Software implementation of something that\\r\\nhad previously existed, but instead wanted to entirely rethink the approach, assumptions, and\\r\\nworkflow encased in the problem. Consequently, the founders’ ideas were multilayered; they\\r\\nneeded to prepare the foundations first and then build up from there. In announcing their plans for Plectrum, the founders created incredible mindshare with their\\r\\naudience; the planned goals really captured the imagination of onlookers.

With such a significant journey ahead of them and much of it down in the weeds in the low-\\r\\nlevel parts of their plan, the Plectrum founders discovered that attracting contributors was more\\r\\ndifficult than they expected, but they plodded on. As the months rolled by, the project\\r\\ncontinued to chalk up its big ideas, release video interviews, and continue work on the lower\\r\\nlayers. Months turned into years, and while the founders of the project were still working\\r\\nsolidly on these lower-level pieces, they hit troubled waters when they decided to ask for\\r\\ndonations to fund the continuation of the project. The issue here was not in asking for money (although money is often contentious in Free\\r\\nSoftware communities), but that this appeal for donations suddenly brought the credibility of\\r\\nthe project and its founders crashing into view. A blogger then posted a somewhat cynical post\\r\\noutlining concerns about the ability of the project to deliver on its promises, and a swathe of\\r\\ncommentators lined the corridor of conversation, many in raging agreement about such\\r\\nconcerns.

As I mentioned earlier, community management is\\r\\nstill very much a misunderstood art and science, and we need not only to build credibility but\\r\\nalso to demonstrate the ways we bring value to both the community and the company that\\r\\nemploys us. 274   CHAPTER NINE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6f14b447-c8d0-4c9f-8774-c95ce70e7560":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6f14b447-c8d0-4c9f-8774-c95ce70e7560\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"kZMnuKstnKBmkB0B2hWVHWx0cHH7s6ZPcSIvAKMoQ4Q=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"1nA9dma4YsAMULJg+1RqUEOfQEL+eCTSmTXAKb+QEQ8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d1fe324d-6413-42ca-b02e-dbab271cbae0\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"s8ue+H+J15dYv9L2rMxQGA47586nwaewHokjd3D9x3E=\"}},\"hash\":\"7cM0IKS4UNonImREvKsmYcrF3Ackf59LCrDWjLLFxTk=\",\"text\":\"At the 2011 gathering of the Community Leadership Summit event I organize each year, I\\r\\nscheduled a session to discuss how we effectively communicate our accomplishments and\\r\\nprogress to different stakeholders in our companies.

Some attendees were expected to show pure\\r\\ngrowth figures (e.g., the number of Twitter followers, forum posts, etc.), some were expected\\r\\nto transpose community into a dollar figure (e.g., how many leads from the community result\\r\\nin sales), and some had no accountability for their work at all. It is clear that no consistent requirements or formats for demonstrating progress span across\\r\\nall companies.

Numbers don’t really tell us anything, though. The\\r\\nchallenge here is not in identifying what numbers can represent our work best, but in how we\\r\\nbring value to the company and to the community. Value. Write it down on a sticky note. Stick it to your monitor. Stick it to your cat. Stick it to your\\r\\nshower head. Wherever you focus your attention, stick that word there: Value.

In other words, if your work aligns with the company’s general goals,\\r\\nit will be easier to justify the value you and your team bring to the company. When I started at Canonical and reported directly to the founder, Mark Shuttleworth, I had\\r\\npretty much free reign in terms of where I directed my efforts. Mark trusted my judgment and\\r\\nI worked to bring value to those areas. While this happy-go-lucky, free-form approach worked\\r\\nwell back then, the company has since grown significantly, there are many more stakeholders\\r\\nnow, and our strategic focus is far wider. As the company and my career progressed, I raised\\r\\nthe importance of identifying the company focus and goals so that I could ensure that my team\\r\\nwould bring value to these needs as well as the needs of the community. As an example, at Canonical we started a project to strategically see growth in the number of\\r\\npeople creating applications for the Ubuntu platform, as well as growing a wider awareness of\\r\\nthe company. I can break this into two broad areas:\\r\\nPlatform maturity\\r\\nWe needed to make the platform easier to use, create more documentation, do a better\\r\\njob of disseminating news, encourage developers to write more applications, grow the\\r\\nawareness of those applications, and communicate required improvements back to the\\r\\nengineers.

All of these tasks are things we can work on with the community. Together we can improve\\r\\nhow the platform functions, improve the documentation, raise company and brand awareness,\\r\\nand more. Likewise, as a community we can better raise the visibility of the company while\\r\\nperforming this work. By identifying where the company as a whole (which typically means where the senior execs\\r\\nsee the company going) wishes to build value, your team can architect a set of projects that\\r\\nbring value to those areas.

Before we continue through this chapter and get into the specifics, I want to ensure that you\\r\\ndon’t make a mistake that a lot of new community managers at companies make. While we\\r\\nhave clearly articulated the importance of tracking and demonstrating progress in your work,\\r\\nit is important to remember that you need to report both down (to your team and the\\r\\ncommunity) as well as up (to your manager and, if applicable, his manager). The mistake is in\\r\\nthinking that the same level of detail is required both up and down the chain. Your community and your team love detail. They love it because detail demonstrates the\\r\\nopenness and transparency of your community and the opportunity for the community to see\\r\\nwhat work is going on. Your manager and his manager don’t need that level of detail; they\\r\\nhave so many other, bigger fish to fry that excessive detail will feel like a tremendous\\r\\ninconvenience. You could provide this detail, but they probably won’t read it. So you need to\\r\\nprovide an effective summary of accomplishments to build confidence and credibility without\\r\\nblinding them with science. As you read this chapter, always think about how you can track and report progress at these\\r\\ntwo levels of detail; additional detail for the community and your team, and summarized detail\\r\\nfor management and other key stakeholders. We will discuss one useful approach for doing\\r\\nthis later in the chapter. BE CAREFUL WITH SPECIFICS\\r\\nFor those of you who are quite new to working professionally as a community manager, I want to\\r\\nshare a quick tip before we move on. Community is a living, breathing organism. Things change in a fluid manner; people join, people\\r\\nleave, and people who start out as incredibly committed contributors get busy and move on. In all\\r\\nthis flux you should be wary of committing too hard to specific metrics or figures. I made this mistake once, early in my career. Our developer community was doing well and growing\\r\\nquickly. In the heat of the moment, while talking with the founder of the company, I committed to\\r\\ndeliver 300 new developers within a year. This, my friends, was a bonkers thing to commit to.

What We Need to Manage\\r\\nNow that we have established the importance of managing and tracking the different\\r\\ncomponents of our community, let’s get down to the details of what we should be tracking\\r\\nand some techniques we can use to do this well. In every community there are three broad areas in which you should have a solid workflow\\r\\nin place for tracking the work performed. They are:\\r\\nProjects\\r\\nA project is a unit of work that results in a particular outcome. Each project has a collection\\r\\nof steps that must be executed to achieve that outcome, and these steps are typically\\r\\ndistributed across lots of different people, many of whom may be volunteers. Examples of\\r\\nprojects include creating a website for a community team, building team reporting into\\r\\nyour community, creating a new product feature, and forming a governance council. Growth and decline\\r\\nCommunities are composed of many different moving parts. Examples include teams,\\r\\nprocesses for contributing work, governance boards, and more. For each moving part we\\r\\nwant to track the growth and decline of content and people to ensure that they are working\\r\\neffectively. General health\\r\\nOutside of our projects and the mechanics of how our community operates, we also want\\r\\nto get a feel for the general health of the community, where we are seeing positive work,\\r\\nand where there are issues that need to be resolved. For the rest of this chapter, we will explore these three areas. Each requires a slightly different\\r\\napproach and operates under different constraints. I am going to present some approaches and\\r\\nexamples that you can apply to your own communities to get better visibility on your work\\r\\nand that of the community. Tracking Projects\\r\\nProjects are a key piece of furniture in every community. Without a clearly defined set of\\r\\nprojects to keep your community members occupied and feeling like there is a sense of focus\\r\\nand direction, your community will feel limp and ineffective. No one likes limp and ineffective. 278   CHAPTER NINE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"faea89c2-f57d-4924-9554-123939f753bb":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"faea89c2-f57d-4924-9554-123939f753bb\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"/0lWUP5ypPefXyLVb3u6ubslhW4W/fNbQbl9F2ii9V0=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"n2HZS2ZQCqferw450js1luy1+kjioPD6TemhCjGmCJ4=\"}},\"hash\":\"kypDeQBJFy27kCgzVVB7UJYXZr872sHugPAYqID6QPk=\",\"text\":\"Take a moment and cast your mind way back to the dim, distant depths of “Baking in\\r\\nOpenness” on page 46 (you can cheat if you want and flip back to that section), and you might\\r\\nremember that we created a strategic plan for our community.

When we can conceptualize these layers it helps us to better\\r\\nconstruct and manage our projects so that different people can see the projects with different\\r\\nlenses that expose different levels of detail. These three layers are:\\r\\nThe Project level\\r\\nThe Project level is the highest level of abstraction, where we just need to know whether\\r\\nthe project is on track or not. The SUCCESS CRITERIA in our strategic plan help us to ask\\r\\na definitive question about whether we succeeded in delivering the requirements of the\\r\\nproject. For projects that are not yet complete, we also need to be able to take an acid test\\r\\nat any time to determine whether the project is generally on track. The Work Unit level\\r\\nIn our strategic plan, the OBJECTIVE defines the high-level project and each GOAL\\r\\nspecifies individual pieces of work that need to be completed to deliver the wider project\\r\\ngoal. Each GOAL component may be owned and assigned to different people, and we need\\r\\na means to identify whether work is succeeding at this slightly lower level. The Work Item level\\r\\nEach work unit is divided into a collection of work items that document individual tasks,\\r\\neach assigned to one person and taking no longer than half a day to complete. This is the\\r\\nhighest level of detail required, and most people would only see this level of detail for\\r\\nprojects they are actively involved in (and for which they have work items assigned to\\r\\nthem). In a perfect world we would see all work items from all units and be able to see\\r\\nprogress on each (we will talk about how to do this later in the chapter). For each layer we want to provide visibility on progress made toward achieving eventual\\r\\noutcomes. Each layer maps reasonably well to the visibility required for different people\\r\\ninterested in our projects. As an example, your manager is likely to be interested only in the Project level; she is going to\\r\\nbe so busy with her own work that she doesn’t want to be swamped with the details.

NOTE\\r\\nOf course, some of you may feel uncomfortable about working so out in the open\\r\\nand with so much visibility into your work. For projects that don’t involve sensitive\\r\\nor confidential information, I recommend that you work as openly as possible. It\\r\\nwill be a little unusual at first, but it gets easier and will raise your credibility in a\\r\\nvery practical and visible way. For sensitive projects, keep as much out in the open\\r\\nas possible, but obviously respect confidences where appropriate. When I started working at Canonical as the Ubuntu community manager, my work was far\\r\\nmore unstructured in terms of visibility on projects. I would choose areas in which I felt the\\r\\ncommunity needed focus, decide on a set of projects that needed to happen to see\\r\\nimprovements, and work on those projects in a fairly ad hoc way. Progress would be made and\\r\\nthe projects would typically succeed, but they were hiding in plain sight; while the projects were\\r\\nopen and transparent, finding details on their progress was difficult for those who were not\\r\\ndirectly involved. Today things are quite different. We track projects in Ubuntu at a much more granular level\\r\\nand provide the three levels of visibility outlined earlier (Project, Work Unit, and Work Item). While our approach uses tools specific to Ubuntu, the approach can be customized to other\\r\\ntools; the tools are not what is important, the structure is where the value is. Structuring Your Projects\\r\\nThis approach to managing projects hinges on the concept of a blueprint. In Chapter 2 we\\r\\ncreated our strategic plan for our different goals. For each goal we should have a blueprint. A blueprint is a document that captures the current state of a project. The Ubuntu project\\r\\nplaced such a high value on these documents that we built a special blueprints feature into the\\r\\nLaunchpad system that we use to build Ubuntu, but you can store blueprints in whatever way\\r\\nis most convenient for your community.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"1945cbde-578f-40f2-975b-70a4f3ded372":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"1945cbde-578f-40f2-975b-70a4f3ded372\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"sn3rIyGjwsTcTa5BtGfSB4ym9PZCwHXjDt13NBR2XxI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"70AGh+lf8KN0z3n/+mAl1pH3MJIufeVzhe8RnA18jG8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"580e160d-bc85-4bf6-bba9-5b4277f45058\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"D9jVsIeOS+gBIjJbiIM6FnN7fwENtjvOJBr9v55h2So=\"}},\"hash\":\"rY0QhLxtZ9eal4fEwhudH7KvG0eafpgpU3czvnYg1oA=\",\"text\":\"This could be wiki pages, text files, items in a database,\\r\\nor somewhere else.

This should get the reader up to speed on the focus of the work. Status\\r\\nThe current status of the work encompassed in the blueprint. Typical status values are Not\\r\\nStarted, In Progress, Slow Progress, Blocked, Completed, and Postponed. This field should\\r\\nalways be kept up-to-date and should provide a singular overview of the current state of\\r\\nthe blueprint. Priority\\r\\nThe blueprint’s priority within the range of projects you are working on. This should be\\r\\nEssential, High, Medium, or Low.

Owner\\r\\nThe person who is responsible for delivering the blueprint. This should match the OWNER\\r\\nset for the OBJECTIVE in your strategic plan. This person should be expected to oversee\\r\\ncompletion of the blueprint. This person may not complete the blueprint himself, but is\\r\\nresponsible for guiding those who have work items on that blueprint to deliver them to\\r\\ncompletion, thus accomplishing the blueprint. Milestone target\\r\\nThe target completion date for the blueprint. It is called a milestone target because\\r\\ncommunities often have common milestones that adjust with each release iteration (e.g.,\\r\\nFeature Freeze, Beta). These six pieces of information provide high-level visibility of the project; a manager or third\\r\\nparty can easily identify whether the project is on track. Of course, the data is only as accurate\\r\\nas the reality it represents, so be sure to keep these details up-to-date. I recommend reviewing\\r\\nall your blueprints on a weekly basis and checking that everything is current and accurate. NOTE\\r\\nAn even better approach is to automate updates for some of the details. As an\\r\\nexample, the Status field could be updated by counting how many work items are\\r\\ncompleted, how quickly progress is being made, and so on. A descriptive blueprint documents your range of projects and work units at a high level. Now\\r\\nyou need to define your work items. 282   CHAPTER NINE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"67b5478e-9052-44ea-97c6-3aca74fe42e0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"67b5478e-9052-44ea-97c6-3aca74fe42e0\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"T48RoAeb0ZmvUL0AQozOdjxfKYgcwdAnjqtVi7a0BQw=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"kgBPRvRT1yoWowZH7fIcgrlbsYnNoTp/AKBrGOs2lSM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"4202ca9d-0ce6-4283-adee-85bcae2b4fc7\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"iR6PxPTZ1uv3PzDOLl5fmd7qrKtt1mYZlzA+uJglDdc=\"}},\"hash\":\"YfDRNFoBSPhmb4e9lAKC2Xtca5+l2Qc8r/iFBBzAO0c=\",\"text\":\"Managing Work Items\\r\\nBack when I was a freshly minted manager, the company organized some management\\r\\ntraining sessions to help develop skills among the managers and build best practices in the\\r\\ncompany.

Short and stocky, with a smile like a banana and\\r\\na pleasingly bubbly personality, Irene was welcomed to the group. There we sat, looking\\r\\nforward to a brisk day of management training. About 20 minutes in we wanted to kill ourselves. Although only a scrooge would knock Irene\\r\\nfor her happy-go-lucky approach to the world, she was steadily beginning to get on our nerves. The issue was not her bubbly nature, it was what she was trying to teach us. She would pick topics that seemed obvious and simple, even to a teenager, and then would\\r\\nthoroughly teach each of our grandmothers how to suck eggs, one by one, in slow, excruciating\\r\\ndetail. We dutifully sat there, exchanging looks with one another as if to say, “I can’t believe\\r\\nwe have to sit through this. Is she going to teach us how to use a spoon next? ”\\r\\nAs the day progressed, Irene continued to waffle on, and our eyelids struggled to stay open\\r\\nfrom the crushing weight of boredom. Eventually the session came to a close. We thanked\\r\\nIrene heartily, she seemed happy with her work, and we left to drown our sorrows at our usual\\r\\nwatering hole. That night we all sat there as new managers, thinking we knew how all this\\r\\nworked, thinking we knew the answers and feeling somewhat smug that so-called management\\r\\ntrainers tried to teach us what we already knew.

As an example, imagine that my wife, Erica, and I are going to cook\\r\\na meal for some friends who are coming over for dinner. Erica is a stunning cook with a great\\r\\nlove of food. I am a terrible cook with a great love of eating Erica’s food. As such, Erica and I\\r\\nboth have clearly defined roles; she is the cook and I try to do all the other fairly unintelligent\\r\\nthings that only someone with terrible cooking skills can be trusted to do. This includes things such as:\\r\\n•   Go to the store and buy the ingredients. •   Chop the cilantro and parsley. •   Juice and zest the lemons. •   Make the salads. •   Pour the chef a few glasses of wine. These seem like reasonable work items, but looks can be deceiving. While “Chop the cilantro\\r\\nand parsley” seems straightforward, it assumes that I know how much cilantro and parsley are\\r\\nrequired for the dish. If the work item read “Finely chop 1/2 cup of cilantro and 1 cup of\\r\\nparsley” the expectations would be much clearer. The “Go to the store and buy the ingredients” work item is even worse. The only way I could\\r\\nsuccessfully achieve it is if I knew which ingredients are required for the dish and which store\\r\\nI need to get them from. It would be better if that specific item were broken into a series of\\r\\nother work items, such as:\\r\\n•   Buy 1 lb of imported prosciutto from Lunardi’s. •   Buy 1 gallon of low-fat milk from Safeway. •   Buy one bunch of parsley from Safeway. Here the work items are much more specific; they indicate the ingredients required, the\\r\\namount needed, and where they can be purchased. This example demonstrates two key points:\\r\\nwork items need to be small and specific, and the scope of the work required should be clear.

Actually, writing down work items serves a few useful purposes, in\\r\\naddition to just helping us to not forget the work items. First, we always want to ensure that the hard work we put into defining our work items is\\r\\ncaptured in such a way that everyone can get a copy. I always recommend that work items be\\r\\nstored online somewhere, be it a wiki, website, formalized work item tracker, or something\\r\\nelse. This will ensure that everyone who has a work item (and even those who don’t, but are\\r\\ncurious to see how well the project is running) can see who is assigned what and when it should\\r\\nbe delivered. Storing work items in a public place also has another subtle benefit. Project management theory\\r\\nhas taught us that when you provide the list of work items in a public place where your peers\\r\\ncan see that you have work assigned to you, it significantly increases the likelihood of you\\r\\ncompleting the action for the simple reason that you don’t want to look like a lazy slacker in\\r\\nfront of your peers. In a world where we strive for transparency in our communities, we can\\r\\nuse transparency as an excellent reason to ensure that these work items are public. ;-).

All we need to do is to be consistent in how we describe each work item. Here is\\r\\nour earlier example, now in this new format:\\r\\n[tomaraya] Produce a first draft of a Code of Conduct: TODO\\r\\nThe format is simple. On the left, in square brackets, is the name of the person the work item\\r\\nis assigned to (in the Ubuntu world we use the person’s username). This is followed by a\\r\\ndescription of the work item, and finally a colon followed by a status description in uppercase\\r\\nletters. We use four different types of status:\\r\\nTODO\\r\\nThe item has not been started. INPROGRESS\\r\\nThe item is currently being worked on. DONE\\r\\nThe item has been successfully completed. POSTPONED\\r\\nThe item was put on hold for some reason (e.g., the assignee left the community, there is\\r\\na lack of time or resources, etc.). Because each work item bears one of these status descriptions, it is easy to check the current\\r\\nstatus of a given item. These simple, consistent descriptions also enable us to write software\\r\\ntools to read in these actions and generate graphs, as we will discuss later.

As described throughout this book,\\r\\nI would identify a mission statement, and then build a strategic plan. Back then I tracked actions\\r\\nin my own TODO list tracker and things seemed to work rather well. Part of the reason I had\\r\\nbecome more organized was because my team was growing, the community was growing, and\\r\\nI needed better visibility on the projects and initiatives I was involved in. Things were getting busier, though, and I knew that would only continue. I needed to handle\\r\\nthis growth and expansion while adhering to my stubborn resistance to overtly bureaucratic\\r\\nproject management techniques. I was and still am entirely in favor of being on top of my\\r\\nprojects, but there is too much fashion in the project management world, and I was reluctant\\r\\nto change my team’s workflow to use the latest project management gimmick that people were\\r\\ntalking about at conferences. Around that time, Rick Spencer joined Canonical. Rick joined as a colleague in the Ubuntu\\r\\nEngineering Management team and we started to work together. We became fast friends as\\r\\nwell as colleagues. While at a company conference, Rick delivered a presentation explaining\\r\\nburndown charts. I sat in the audience, curious but unconvinced. It sounded like another\\r\\nproject management fad, so I ignored it and carried on with my work. However, Rick’s presentation resonated with the other engineering managers. One by one\\r\\ntheir teams started using the burndown charts that he had presented. This approach not only\\r\\nmeant documenting and tracking actions as described in this chapter, but also meant tracking\\r\\nthis work very publicly, which the burndown charts made easy to do. In retrospect, I think the\\r\\ntransparency and visibility these charts lent to my team’s contributions also contributed to my\\r\\nreluctance to use burndown charts. This was not because I was not proud of their work, but\\r\\nbecause I was insecure about my management abilities. Eventually, all the other engineering managers were using burndown charts and I was the last\\r\\nman standing.

Second, you want to communicate the progress\\r\\nof this work effectively to onlookers (and, if relevant, to management at your company). Burndown charts help you do this. Figure 9-1 shows an example chart. FIGURE 9-1. Burndown charts are an effective tool for visualizing progress. The burndown chart is essentially a bar chart. Along the y-axis are the total number of work\\r\\nitems. Along the x-axis is the total length of time allocated for all the work items to be\\r\\ncompleted. As an example, in the Ubuntu community we release every six months; therefore,\\r\\nI target all work to a six-month release cycle and we have a six-month burndown chart. The way the chart works is that each day a new bar is drawn on the chart from the left to the\\r\\nright of the x-axis. This bar is broken into three different sections:\\r\\nLower, darker color\\r\\nThe number of work items that are still marked as TODO and therefore have not been\\r\\nstarted. Middle, lighter color\\r\\nThe number of work items that have been marked as DONE and therefore are complete. Top, lightest color (where appropriate)\\r\\nThe number of work items marked as POSTPONED, so we do not count them against our\\r\\ncompletion status. This color may not appear in all bars or even all burndown charts. Each bar that is rendered on the graph basically shows the proportion of TODO, DONE, and\\r\\nPOSTPONED items.

GENERATING YOUR BURNDOWN CHARTS\\r\\nIn all of this discussion about documenting work items and generating burndown charts, we have\\r\\nnot yet covered the all-important question of how you get your work items to generate one of these\\r\\nlovely charts. Fortunately, a range of options are available, including generating charts in Basecamp, Microsoft\\r\\nExcel, and other tools. I am not going to provide a list of links that probably will be outdated by the\\r\\ntime you read this; instead, go to your favorite search engine and do a search for “generating\\r\\nburndown charts,” and you will get a slew of results. To generate burndown charts for the Ubuntu project, we actually wrote a few custom Python scripts. We keep our work items in Launchpad and the Python script just pulls out the work items and\\r\\ngenerates a graph on a web page. We built this into a community-founded project that became\\r\\nstatus.ubuntu.com. There are two primary benefits of using burndown charts. First, if you have a small piece of\\r\\nsoftware that reads in the work items automatically and generates the graph, the only work\\r\\nyour community will need to do to keep on top of their work is to ensure that they update the\\r\\nstatus of the work items as DONE, INPROGRESS, or POSTPONED. This provides a simple,\\r\\nnonbureaucratic method of tracking and visualizing progress.

One of the most valuable benefits a burndown chart\\r\\nprovides is a way to look over the duration of the work period and identify patterns that can\\r\\nhelp you to build on and improve your work.

Another interesting pattern is what happens after the lull; you can see a significant burst of\\r\\nprogress. Again, identify what occurred at that time. Causes for this can be leaders and\\r\\nmanagers encouraging folks to ratchet up the progress after a lull, events such as sprints or\\r\\nhackfests in which teams get together to burst through work items, or particular milestones\\r\\nsuch as the final days before a feature freeze or release. Each possibility teaches you something\\r\\nabout your team’s productivity and how to improve it. Finally, another hugely useful pattern to observe is the proportion and pattern of POSTPONED\\r\\nitems. In Figure 9-2, a small proportion of POSTPONED items appears in the bars on the\\r\\nrighthand side of the chart. This tells us a few things. First, seeing a growing trend of postponed\\r\\nitems at this point in the chart (just over a quarter of the way through) is a concern. This would\\r\\nsignal to me to keep an eye on how many work items get postponed and what the cause could\\r\\nbe.

The number of postponed items often gives you an idea of whether you are agreeing\\r\\nto too much work in the set time period.

As we\\r\\nhave already discussed throughout this chapter, your management and, if applicable, senior\\r\\nmanagement are likely to want to dig in here and there and get an idea of how productive the\\r\\ncommunity is and how effective you are. Earlier we talked about delivering results at a project\\r\\nlevel, in which you are coordinating a team and community members to work together to\\r\\nbring value, but you should also strive to present an idea of how your community is growing,\\r\\nand how effectively your community-facing processes are working. The first challenge is to know what to track. As we discussed earlier in the book, generating\\r\\nstatistics for the purpose of generating statistics is a bad thing to do. Our goal here is instead to\\r\\nidentify how we determine value in our community, and to track those figures to give us an\\r\\nidea of where value is being created and where value is being lost. Although I wish I could write a big list of areas in which you should create metrics, this is\\r\\nheavily dependent on your community. One approach that I have developed that can help,\\r\\nthough, is a set of questions you can ask to help you determine this set of key value judgments. Let’s look at these three questions, and then I will provide an example afterward:\\r\\nWho contributes? Summarize the primary classifications of the primary contributors to your community. Divide these by the types of value they bring, primarily in terms of different skills. How do they participate? For each type of contributor that you just wrote down, also note how each interacts with\\r\\nyour community to make those contributions. These should primarily be the processes\\r\\nand infrastructure they use to participate. What do they deliver? For each group, write down what value they bring in a practical and measurable form. Let’s now look at an example. The Ubuntu community is a large one, so I am going to look at\\r\\nthree primary groups to keep this example lean:\\r\\n•   Who contributes? — Developers\\r\\n— Advocates\\r\\n— Translators\\r\\n•   How do they participate? — Developers\\r\\n— Sponsorship queue\\r\\n— Developer approval process\\r\\n— Bug Tracker\\r\\nMANAGING AND TRACKING WORK   295\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2e468ef6-fefa-4003-a451-64738f7e0e09":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2e468ef6-fefa-4003-a451-64738f7e0e09\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"9U6skjiI265pznxTqOFEMNYKBfppfP3Tsxwc9eyI2z4=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"66HBJOb6Hj4yQvLft5WtSmLnHAOA0Ssm1pXruGDUIHk=\"}},\"hash\":\"sOxy9EZVrvorZZe3SiFXc5Uxs28Gn0kDhsBPB6hT33k=\",\"text\":\"Advocates\\r\\nLoCo teams\\r\\nloco.ubuntu.com\\r\\nTranslators\\r\\nTranslations interface\\r\\nWhat do they deliver?

Visibility Is Key\\r\\nBack in 2010 my team faced an interesting challenge with regard to growth. This experience\\r\\nhelped us to continue to shape our approach in how we track community growth and gain\\r\\nbetter visibility on what is going on. Each quarter I would ask my team to prepare a summary of key community metrics for the\\r\\nsenior management team. These metrics would include things such as developer growth (folks\\r\\nwho build Ubuntu packages and fix bugs), forum growth, the number of local user group events\\r\\nbeing organized, active levels of participation, and so on. Each quarter we would prepare the\\r\\nstatistics, and generally they were on the uptick. For this particular quarter in 2010 I noticed\\r\\nsomething slightly disconcerting: our developer growth statistics were beginning to flatten out\\r\\na little. They were not declining, but I saw this as a warning shot. I immediately got on the phone with Daniel Holbach, who has the job on my team of growing\\r\\nthe developer community. We discussed the possible reasons for this flattening effect. Were\\r\\npeople less interested in participating in Ubuntu? Was our documentation too complex or\\r\\nsparse? Were there too few opportunities to participate? Were we not inspiring the community\\r\\nenough to take part? While we could hypothesize about what it could be, we realized we didn’t\\r\\nhave any solid data to determine the cause for this decline. 296   CHAPTER NINE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"978faecc-5fbf-4398-83c6-103850ac0c30":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"978faecc-5fbf-4398-83c6-103850ac0c30\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"sira3MZI+Np8JtIna+cTb+62G7BeJYnkMmkQH4eOLyY=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"QWTpHtYjhqNicZXxPnYboZKEAqdXCBzUpIci4UaqqGA=\"}},\"hash\":\"DKG0b1scC9e2MKaTcga3mTlVutUGJw5i1k68T/JWlno=\",\"text\":\"To get better visibility, I asked Daniel to put together a survey that would go out to all current\\r\\ndevelopers to get a better idea of their perspectives.

In Ubuntu you need to get approval before you can upload changes to the archives, so we have\\r\\nmany contributors who perform various contributions to build trust so that they can get\\r\\napproved. In my discussion with Daniel, I realized I had very little visibility on (a) who these\\r\\nfolks are, (b) their contributions, and (c) how we can better support them to get through the\\r\\ndeveloper process. I asked Daniel to help me get this visibility. I asked him to determine a way we could generate\\r\\na series of graphs of the same time period, with each graph showing spikes of when and to\\r\\nwhat extent a community developer contributed to Ubuntu. This would help give us an idea\\r\\nof who was performing significant and sustained contributions, which is the basic criterion for\\r\\ngetting approval as a developer. Daniel went away and figured out that he could generate these graphs by processing messages\\r\\nsent to the commit mailing list (a mailing list that automatically gets emailed whenever a new\\r\\nupdate is made). Daniel would read in all these commits, weed out the approved developers,\\r\\nand generate graphs for everyone else.

Therefore, this person would be a strong candidate for developer approval; the\\r\\nregularity of contributions certainly shows promise. Interestingly, though, the person’s\\r\\ncontributions stop abruptly in April 2011. This could be for a variety of reasons: vacation, family\\r\\nissues, busy with the day job, having a child, and so on. For this particular contributor I asked\\r\\nDaniel to reach out and check that everything was OK, and to suggest that the person consider\\r\\napplying to be an approved developer. The second graph down in the figure shows a different story. This person started contributing\\r\\nin June 2009, then started in April 2010 to contribute really heavily until about September\\r\\n2010, whereupon the activity just stopped. In fact, this person’s activity has remained dormant\\r\\nfor much longer than the time shown in the graph.

Importantly, though, having the graphs is only part of the story; if you don’t interpret\\r\\nthe data to continue to improve your community processes and on-ramps, you are not using\\r\\nthe information wisely. When I saw these graphs, I put together a mentoring campaign to distribute a mentoring facility\\r\\nacross the wider Ubuntu team.

In the survey we asked the developers what was the most challenging and frustrating element\\r\\nof working on Ubuntu. In other words, what should we focus our death ray on first? The results came in and there was a clear, unanimous answer to this question: bottlenecks. Our developers felt they were feeding information into some processes that were inserting a\\r\\nsignificant delay in returning a response or other output. These developers would contribute\\r\\nin good faith to Ubuntu and then be met with a frustrating delay. Not good. Fortunately, we also asked the developers what they felt these bottlenecks were. We also saw\\r\\nsome unanimous feedback in answer to this question, with one specific winner: the Ubuntu\\r\\nSponsorship Queue. The Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue is a facility we have in which unapproved developers (those\\r\\nwho can’t contribute changes to Ubuntu itself) can fix bugs, create functionality, and get their\\r\\ncontributions reviewed by an approved Ubuntu developer. It works like this:\\r\\n1.Joe Bloggs finds a bug that is frustrating him. He downloads the package source code and\\r\\nfixes the bug. The bug no longer exists on his system and he wants to share his fix and\\r\\nadd it to the main Ubuntu system. 2.Joe is not yet an approved developer and as such doesn’t have upload rights to contribute\\r\\nthe bug fix directly. To submit his fix, he generates a patch for it (a file with the key code\\r\\nchanges that fix the bug) and adds the patch to the bug report. He then adds the bug to\\r\\nthe Ubuntu Sponsorship Queue; this is a big list of bug reports with fixes attached from\\r\\nnonapproved developers. 3.Sarah, who is an approved Ubuntu developer, wakes up one morning and takes a look at\\r\\nthe sponsorship queue. She sees Joe’s fix and reviews his patch. It looks good and she\\r\\nuploads it to Ubuntu on Joe’s behalf. Now Joe’s fix is in Ubuntu and he has made a\\r\\nsuccessful contribution. This process relies on two key pieces to work successfully: it needs to be clear and easy to use\\r\\nfor prospective developers, and it requires our existing approved developer base to actually go\\r\\nand review these contributions.

It was clear that we needed to grow the capacity of developers who were able to review the\\r\\ncontent on the queue, but how could we do this when our approved developers were already\\r\\nso busy? To accomplish this, we started to focus on the Canonical staff members who work on Ubuntu. We started there because we pay these people and therefore have some pull when it comes to\\r\\nhow they spend their time. We basically put together a calendar each month, and every day\\r\\ntwo staff members would spend half a day each reviewing content on the queue. We made it\\r\\nvery clear that their responsibility was to provide an outcome for each item, even if this meant\\r\\nnot reviewing it themselves (because they may not have the domain experience) but ensuring\\r\\nthat someone else reviews it.

HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT\\r\\nA key lesson I learned from this experience was to not assume that as a community manager you\\r\\nwill know where the bottlenecks and challenges in your community may lurk.

The lesson here is to regularly reach out to your community and get their feedback on areas that are\\r\\nworking well and not-so-well.

Promoting a Feedback Culture\\r\\nOne of my biggest fears is that a set of opinions or concerns about my work are circulating and\\r\\nno one has the confidence to tell me. My fear is that these concerns and opinions would\\r\\ncontinue to flow and be shared with people and I would be none the wiser, and as such unable\\r\\nto show a receptivity to the feedback and to try to resolve the concerns where appropriate. In some of our relationships, providing this kind of feedback is expected. I expect my manager\\r\\nto tell me when he thinks I can do a better job. Likewise, my team should expect that I will\\r\\ntell them when they should be doing a better job. But what about me telling my manager how\\r\\nto improve? How about my team telling me? What about the feedback from my manager’s\\r\\nmanager about me; should he censor it before it comes to me? How should I communicate\\r\\nconcerns from my management peers about my team? Things get even more complicated when it comes to community. How should community\\r\\nmembers express feedback to you? How do they express feedback about your team or your\\r\\nmanager? How do you handle feedback from community members about another member? I have always taken a very simple approach to my relationship with others: if there is ever\\r\\nany concern about my work, I want to know. If I don’t know about it I simply can’t fix it. The first day I work for a new manager or a new member joins my team, I always emphasize\\r\\nthis point. My wife and I even have this agreement with each other; we call it our full\\r\\ndisclosure policy. I make it clear to all of these people that I don’t want the feedback censored\\r\\nor deflected, I don’t want to be protected from feedback outside of my pay grade; I want to\\r\\nhear the details so that I can react and resolve the problem appropriately.

Building a Set of Generals\\r\\nIn 2008 I moved to California. When I moved there my entire schedule turned around. In\\r\\nEngland I would typically be on the phone in the afternoons with folks in the United States\\r\\nand have a few calls earlier in the afternoon with UK and European folks. Upon moving to\\r\\nCalifornia that all changed. I was now up every morning at 7 a.m. or 7:30 a.m. to start calls\\r\\nwith Europe. As my job got more complex and my team grew, my calls grew, too. I was getting to a point\\r\\nwhere I was on the phone for 22 hours a week. Like many folks who get into a similar situation,\\r\\nI tried to cull many of these calls that could be accomplished over email. Unfortunately, this\\r\\ndidn’t cut it down very much. I needed a weekly call with each member of my team, a general\\r\\nteam call, a weekly call with my manager, my management call, and regular calls with key\\r\\nstrategic teams and community members. Even when I culled the calls down, I was still clocking\\r\\nup at least 17 hours a week on the phone. This time on the phone meant that my inbox started ballooning, too. As soon as I was finished\\r\\nwith calls I would hit the email, and then finally I could get on with the work I had to\\r\\naccomplish. The net result of all of this activity was that my week became far more compressed\\r\\nand time became a precious commodity. All of this had one unfortunate impact: I found it harder to get a feel for the general health of\\r\\nthe community. I was spending so much time on the damn phone and in email that I didn’t\\r\\nhave as much time to talk to the community, and there were important projects I felt we needed\\r\\nto move forward on that I just didn’t have time to participate in.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cab9dfc6-1061-47e0-84ad-64b3863a2f88":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cab9dfc6-1061-47e0-84ad-64b3863a2f88\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"nN/vfB7KVv3py5YheZY6ASBDfVHNUwZFwrq7q+yxF1w=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"XP+uK0wfv27MmkkHeSNI+BLEzW1bSDAK1zKybg1MHl0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e5225c02-489e-426a-903a-061afa9a4670\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"oUkWtZptjqRLej7TwpSqest9rfuHIY8G0x7ZK4eJJsE=\"}},\"hash\":\"9bJl6a38v92jv+HGEqrp4oqu3WEfVQs/QFohlGkZv4o=\",\"text\":\"With little time available, I\\r\\nwas stuck between a rock and a hard place; how on earth do I get more things done with no\\r\\ntime available?

My primary function was to\\r\\nkeep our eyes on the prize and ensure that the train would move forward. As a result of this\\r\\nwork, some great value was brought to the LoCo teams from these community members. I have set up these calls with a variety of different teams and have found that each time this\\r\\napproach has been really successful.

Throughout\\r\\nthis process I blogged about my receptivity to the concerns, the issuing of the survey, and my\\r\\nencouragement to all community members to provide their input and to be as full and frank\\r\\nas possible. When the survey was complete, I summarized each question into a report, and for the open-\\r\\nended questions (e.g., “What motivates you about the community?”), I summarized the\\r\\ncommon patterns and themes in the responses. I was conscious of providing solid data and to\\r\\nnot massage or influence the perception of the results. I also included the full responses to all\\r\\nthe questions, anonymized to ensure that people could be fully open in their responses. The survey results were fascinating. Not only did they identify that many of the concerns were\\r\\nindeed not particularly representative of the wider community, which was reassuring, but also\\r\\nthey highlighted other areas of growing concern and other areas in which people particularly\\r\\nenjoy participating or find the community motivating. This was good, solid data, and I published it immediately. The community started reviewing and presenting their own views on how to read the data\\r\\nand what potential solutions we could create. I joined in those conversations and could tell\\r\\nthat the tone had changed from frustration to a shared sense of ownership of the challenges. The atmosphere became more empowering and was positive about fixing the issues outlined;\\r\\nthe visibility of the issues clearly provided a sense of having the problem in our sights so that\\r\\nwe could understand and solve them. Building on this momentum, we held a face-to-face community event in the following few\\r\\nweeks and I organized a series of discussion sessions to review the content in the survey, discuss\\r\\nthe topics there, and put together solutions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fbda434f-e067-4552-8ee3-655631ea64b4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fbda434f-e067-4552-8ee3-655631ea64b4\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"T+SnZ1aDKWTQ7h/VXXW/Aw+8/V7nWnDXcVYI8LWPaag=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"x/iNGqMubVJ7x1vkniElG4VDjeJU7ftpWRIAXMTFcu8=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"fba8fb9b-0cef-47d7-ad40-e2a38e5faca9\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"n1PN/4bTWili9XOeKurDO9T4jXyKxsREFD/vp+mkTLo=\"}},\"hash\":\"3nzQqALILv0bGybHNOL2vTWOozWbMWpdOSBJ2Akn2oc=\",\"text\":\"Over the following weeks we started to see many\\r\\nof the issues fading away and the community feeling more involved and empowered.

Mike has\\r\\na passion for helping people with technical problems. He loves the thrill of the chase: hunting\\r\\ndown those pesky issues and helping to fix them for appreciative community members. As a\\r\\ngood community citizen, Mike was on the front line helping new Ubuntu users get acclimated\\r\\nto their new waters. The forums became stunningly popular. Thousands and thousands of excitable community\\r\\nmembers joined, and each day pages of conversation on all manner of topics would flow\\r\\nthroughout the site. Interestingly, unlike most other Linux distribution forums, the Ubuntu\\r\\nForums were not created by the commercial sponsor (in this case Canonical Ltd.).

New moderators needed to be appointed, frustrating conflict\\r\\nissues were becoming more common due to the size and diversity of the forum membership,\\r\\nadministrators needed to distribute maintenance matters, and there was increasing demand\\r\\nfor the forums to integrate with other parts of the Ubuntu community. The forums needed\\r\\ngoverning, and who should be one of the people to step up to the plate? One Mike Basinger. Over the following months, the Forums Council was designed, documented, and ultimately\\r\\napproved by the main Ubuntu Community Council. Alongside his peers on the Forums\\r\\nCouncil, Mike took the lead to govern. He and they did an excellent job, and Mike continued\\r\\nto contribute throughout the community. In March 2007, the highest governing body in the Ubuntu community, the Community\\r\\nCouncil, was preparing to elect a new board of governing members. Clearly impressed with\\r\\nMike’s contributions to the Forums Council and elsewhere, Mark Shuttleworth (the leader of\\r\\nthe Ubuntu project) asked Mike if he would consider a nomination to the Community Council. Somewhat stunned yet flattered, Mike considered Mark’s suggestion and then agreed to be put\\r\\nforth as a nomination. Just before the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville in southern Spain, Mark announced the\\r\\nnominees for the Community Council. The four nominees were put before a Yes/No vote by\\r\\nall approved Ubuntu Members, and Mike was elected to the Community Council in May 2007. It was a good day for Ubuntu, and it was a good day for Mike.

For most communities, this leadership is divided as follows:\\r\\nGeneral governance\\r\\nDecisions that need to be made around general topics that apply to the community as a\\r\\nwhole. This could include things such as how people join the community, resources and\\r\\ninfrastructure, community-wide policies and procedures, governance changes, and so on. Direction\\r\\nDecisions about the goals, ambitions, and focus of the community. As an example, with\\r\\na software project, this kind of leadership would decide which features to aim for in the\\r\\nnext release. In a local civil rights group, this could be how the group is planning to raise\\r\\nawareness and which campaigns will be organized. Specialist governance\\r\\nThis really applies only to larger communities. Specialized governance may be required in\\r\\nspecific areas of expertise. As an example, in a software community the developer\\r\\ncommunity may require its own governance, and so may the discussion forums. For many communities, each type of leadership falls together inside a single governance body. This is particularly common in smaller communities. For example, many user groups have a known collection of leaders who advise and govern\\r\\naround all manner of topics, including how people can join the group, how the group should\\r\\nfocus their efforts, which campaigns should be worked on, how money and assets are handled,\\r\\nand more. It is often the same small set of people who advise on these issues, and the expertise\\r\\nand more general focus of a user group makes this kind of simple approach a perfect solution. For larger or more specialized communities, these separate leadership roles are often divided\\r\\ninto different governance bodies.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"cc7e3e4e-c645-4397-9ece-e77374175a4f":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"cc7e3e4e-c645-4397-9ece-e77374175a4f\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"2PIjlshO/mvTbQMjv2RqQg4fUbbqI7CL/fqucku7d0Y=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"P9IgAAGh9Dyu83DmUVGLBiQFTZyYcsJ/VqCeqSlA2DM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d524eca2-df5b-493a-b36d-f8f52ccbc3a1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"U58bA2TvxV3yG5j+fV0trGNVPRgZ+SlgMmZxG21u9Hg=\"}},\"hash\":\"kYajIwvLs7/OX67Ye3DzEV3SYrFD1Do2lTdSSKU3WwI=\",\"text\":\"For larger or more specialized communities, these separate leadership roles are often divided\\r\\ninto different governance bodies.

Engage the People\\r\\nGovernments are, fundamentally, representatives of the people, and for this representation\\r\\nto be fair and accurate, the government needs to engage with the people.

George Burns, the famous American comedian, replete with arched eyebrow and cigar smoke\\r\\npunctuation, had a lot to say about government. In a 1979 issue of Life magazine, Burns shared\\r\\na nugget of insight that resonated with many people:\\r\\nToo bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxicabs and\\r\\ncutting hair. He isn’t wrong. When I started my career in community management, I spent a lot of time\\r\\ntraveling.

As I moved\\r\\nfrom plane to plane, and ate miniature bag after miniature bag of salted peanuts, I went to\\r\\nmeet and greet the various members of my community. While en route, I had my own\\r\\nopportunity to meet a battalion of taxi drivers, each with his own carefully considered\\r\\nmanifesto of what his government had screwed up and the rather obvious solution to the\\r\\nproblem. I heard views on Chinese politics in San Francisco, opinions of US trade treaties in\\r\\nPrague, and just about everyone had a view on George W. Bush. I suspect that that man doesn’t\\r\\nget as many Christmas cards as he used to.... Virtually all of these taxi drivers had one thing in common: they all felt their voice was rarely\\r\\nheard by their governments.

Of course, there are thousands of communities around the world, with varying governance\\r\\napproaches. Fortunately, there are patterns in the chaos, and there are three prevalent themes\\r\\nin many communities. These are:\\r\\nDictatorial charismatic leadership\\r\\nGovernance and decision making that is largely driven and controlled by a single person\\r\\nGOVERNANCE   321\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c84313bd-f09a-46f2-ae08-2ab719be6945":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c84313bd-f09a-46f2-ae08-2ab719be6945\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"QU/9Cv561MXfQ7LZMOeLWzeGte4//zubW0EjYR+2owg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qKRMnMNydwD/oC9neD5DrGNF2B7DEkoHY2HRCqdcDG0=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"51ae7d8b-6c1c-4683-82e2-1aa0c6303dc5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"lrPQCRA0MWgu0ljao/k0U98qiNGk66VxERF7cPyhhqM=\"}},\"hash\":\"zuR3lFZqNAOgCoxbe2711peigzKVhEk6s6ydlFylFC4=\",\"text\":\"Enlightened dictatorship\\r\\nGovernance that effectively has no formal leader but in which leadership is determined\\r\\nby reputation in the community\\r\\nDelegated governance\\r\\nGovernance that is delegated to a series of smaller units that all fit together to form a single\\r\\ngoverning body\\r\\nLet’s take a quick spin through these different themes and see how they apply to our\\r\\ncommunities. This can provide us with an idea of how we want to structure our own\\r\\ngovernance. Dictatorial Charismatic Leadership\\r\\nPeople hate the word dictator. It typically gets something of a bad reputation in polite\\r\\nconversation. Unfortunately, history has taught us that many of the most famous “dictators”\\r\\nwere mass-murdering psychopaths who foisted their attitudes onto their people. I am sure this\\r\\nis why some of you may have been a little surprised to read that there is a type of acceptable\\r\\ngovernance that is driven by dictators. Fortunately, mass murder is not a common practice in\\r\\nthese communities. Dictator-led communities work just like they say on the tin: they are\\r\\ncommunities in which a single person calls the shots. This person will often set direction and\\r\\nfocus, approve what is acceptable in the community, and in technical communities will be the\\r\\narbiter of what gets included in the project. If you still can’t stomach the word dictator, substitute\\r\\ncharismatic leader in your mind each time I use it. Now, I know what you are thinking: this doesn’t sound very community-spirited. A\\r\\ncommunity in which one person acts as the funnel through which everyone else must flow? Surely that can’t actually work! You would be surprised. There are many dictator-led communities that are popular and attract large numbers of people. Two very prominent technical examples of this are Linux and Python. Within these\\r\\ncommunities exist two highly visible leaders: Linus Torvalds and Guido van Rossum,\\r\\nrespectively. Linus and Guido are the people who have traditionally decided on direction, set\\r\\nfocus, and accepted or rejected contributions. In the Free Software world, one of the most notable cases of dictatorship was the choice of the\\r\\nthird version of the GNU General Public License, perhaps the software license in most\\r\\nwidespread use by Free Software projects (including Linux).\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"51ae7d8b-6c1c-4683-82e2-1aa0c6303dc5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"51ae7d8b-6c1c-4683-82e2-1aa0c6303dc5\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"QU/9Cv561MXfQ7LZMOeLWzeGte4//zubW0EjYR+2owg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qKRMnMNydwD/oC9neD5DrGNF2B7DEkoHY2HRCqdcDG0=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"c84313bd-f09a-46f2-ae08-2ab719be6945\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"zuR3lFZqNAOgCoxbe2711peigzKVhEk6s6ydlFylFC4=\"}},\"hash\":\"lrPQCRA0MWgu0ljao/k0U98qiNGk66VxERF7cPyhhqM=\",\"text\":\"Years of discussion went into this\\r\\nlicense, including intense meetings and negotiations with representatives of companies and\\r\\nsoftware projects of all sizes.

In these communities there is often no open governance, no elections,\\r\\nand no community-discussed focus and direction. Despite these communities’ restrictive nature, time and time again contributors join up and\\r\\nenjoy their involvement. Despite this, however, I recommend against a dictator-led\\r\\ncommunity, for a few reasons:\\r\\nLack of transparency\\r\\nEarlier I went into detail about why openness and transparency are important in volunteer\\r\\ncommunities. Dictatorial communities are something of an antithesis to this approach,\\r\\nand their leaders always face the risk of not representing the views of the wider\\r\\ncommunity. Bus factor\\r\\nCommunities that have a single, strongly focused leader face considerable risk if that leader\\r\\ngets hit by a bus. Other, more openly governed communities are often able to transition\\r\\nto other leaders more efficiently. Direction\\r\\nCommunities with a single leader who decides what direction the community takes can\\r\\nhave difficulty expanding their focus. As an example, if your community is building a\\r\\nwebsite, the leader may stick with outdated ideas of how it should be structured and\\r\\nbehave after the rest of the world has moved to new technologies and architectures. There\\r\\nis a very real risk of “It’s my ball and we are playing my game” with this approach. Of course, if you are the founder of your community, only you can decide whether the\\r\\ndictatorial approach is suitable. In almost all scenarios I recommend against it, and if you are\\r\\nkeen to have a strong level of control, at least delegate some control to councils (as we will\\r\\ndiscuss in the section “Delegated Governance” on page 325). Technical communities who have successfully implemented the dictatorial model often refer\\r\\nto their primary leader as a benevolent dictator. This term is inspired by historical leaders such\\r\\nas Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia; Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of Bohemia; and\\r\\nFrederick II of Prussia, King of Germany, who led and governed their people as dictators but\\r\\napplied rationality to their approaches. In historical terms, this rationality was manifested as religious toleration, freedom of speech\\r\\nand the press, and the right to hold private property. In the technical space, benevolent\\r\\ndictators apply the same sense of rationality to toleration, and freedom of speech and press,\\r\\nbut also often inspire open contributions, delegated responsibilities, and more.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8f248f49-f620-43b8-9393-f734465b9ed7":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8f248f49-f620-43b8-9393-f734465b9ed7\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"s4dsEzMSmfYRFlzU/VqZrExzZ6jnOCqI9iNNqEwyipc=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"kIxDy4zXFRy9K+MwwWlooTy5dPv6gkfrqV/Dgb8w1Ew=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5902a1a1-31ff-4a48-b0d5-893e2968a8ee\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"AsQ+jyvmHj5hpf4OnG0IVdrUWD8KJYrinMQ9a+6g5rQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"fNc4zsRgtjg8FqXQ3IhTMBhvDlXMxXRCyRpqzDBnkVI=\",\"text\":\"Enlightened Dictatorship\\r\\nIn contrast to dictatorship and benevolent dictators, a popular form of community that has\\r\\ngrown in both online and offline communities is enlightened dictatorship.

My C++ skills were, frankly, pants. I tried my best to learn. I bought books, read websites, took\\r\\ncourses, and even watched tuition videos hosted by a man with a kipper tie. Despite my\\r\\nbumbling attempts at C++, one magical opportunity existed: I knew that if I could gain those\\r\\nskills, I was welcome in that community. Of course, these days a more diverse menu of\\r\\nopportunities is available for those who want to participate in KDE, but even in the dark age\\r\\nof when I was involved, openness was always present. Although KDE has hundreds of contributors from around the word, there is no formalized\\r\\nleader that exists beyond the limited set of developers who look after the different chunks of\\r\\ncode (called modules) and the release manager. It is the many developers involved in KDE\\r\\nwho are the arbiters of which bugs get fixed and what features are added.

Delegated Governance\\r\\nOur final approach to governance is the one I find most appropriate, open, transparent, and\\r\\nconducive to robust community. In essence, it puts governance in the hands of an openly\\r\\nnominated and elected group of people who have respected and recognized expertise. Many powerful examples of this approach to governance are in place, and it is an approach\\r\\nthat we have used extensively in the Ubuntu project. We are not alone, though; each major\\r\\nLinux distribution takes the same approach, including Debian, Fedora, and OpenSuSE. In delegated governance, the founders of the project nominate a diverse body of leaders to\\r\\nrepresent the best interests of the community. This governing body has a mandate and a set\\r\\nof responsibilities, along with a transparent procedure for electing or otherwise replacing\\r\\nmembers, and these members are typically chosen for their well-respected contributions to the\\r\\ncommunity. Although the approach is very open and transparent, it does have one distinctive\\r\\nrisk: complexity. Building an open yet responsible governance body is not a particularly simple task. You need\\r\\nto know what you want to achieve, how to structure the governance, what are the\\r\\nrequirements of your members, and how to ensure that your community is fully supportive\\r\\nof the authority put in the hands of the resultant Community Council. That can appear complicated to put in place, and can also seem overly complex to your\\r\\ncommunity.

Setting Up a Community Council\\r\\nIf you follow my advice and choose delegated governance—or at least some elements of it—\\r\\nyou need to build a governance body. For many communities this means forming a council. A\\r\\ncouncil is a group of selected members in a community who govern collectively. Issues and\\r\\ntopics can be presented to this council, and they will come to a united opinion that is typically\\r\\nconcluded in a vote. As an example, if the council has seven members, they may allocate 20\\r\\nminutes to discussing a proposal and let it go forward if four members support it. (In practice,\\r\\nif your council is deciding a lot of issues on the basis of a bare majority, the community is not\\r\\nwell governed and there is likely to be destructive conflict—but we’re just covering the basic\\r\\nprinciple here. )\\r\\nMany communities form a Community Council, a single council that governs the entire\\r\\ncommunity. For most communities this is a great solution, but larger communities benefit from\\r\\ndelegating some authority from the Community Council to additional subcouncils. For now,\\r\\nthough, we are going to explore what is involved in setting up a single Community Council to\\r\\ngovern your community. COUNCILS VERSUS TEAMS\\r\\nThis chapter discusses long-term forms of governance, which are basically invested in councils or\\r\\nboards. This is different from groups that form more organically and naturally to handle particular\\r\\nobjectives or goals in your strategic plan. The less formal groups are usually called teams or\\r\\ncommittees. I talked about teams in Chapter 2, and they are certainly the basis for effective community\\r\\nwork. But teams or committees focus on getting some concrete task done, not on governance, so I\\r\\ndon’t cover them in this chapter. Certainly, a council can form a team to handle a specific task related to governance, such as writing\\r\\none of the documents I describe in this chapter or nominating members for councils.

Obviously, the limits are even more\\r\\nimportant for subcouncils so that they don’t make decisions at cross-purposes. Designing and documenting your council is important for three reasons:\\r\\n•   Explicitly discussing the council’s responsibilities will help you as a community leader\\r\\nunderstand the full rationale behind the council and how it should work. •Clear expectations also help all council members know how to handle their responsibilities\\r\\nand will make them more willing to serve. •A well-designed and -documented council will protect your community from accusations\\r\\nof corruption. If the remit and extent of the council are well known and the members are\\r\\nknown to act within those expectations, accusations of favoritism or misuse of authority\\r\\nwill be rare. The building blocks of a council are your decisions regarding:\\r\\n•   Responsibilities\\r\\n•   Structure\\r\\n•   Membership\\r\\n•   Communication\\r\\nThe next few sections of this chapter look at the choices you have for each of these building\\r\\nblocks, and some of the criteria that help you make your choice.

As such, Tobe has a large and bustling contributor\\r\\ncommunity, so large that we are feeling the need for a Community Council to help guide the\\r\\nproject forward and ensure that the community is always open and accessible. Responsibilities\\r\\nThe primary purpose of a council is to provide fair governance and feedback on an agreed set\\r\\nof responsibilities in the community. What you choose as these responsibilities will vary: it is\\r\\nhighly dependent on your community. But your community needs to be united in agreement\\r\\nabout what these responsibilities are. We need the community to be fully aware of what\\r\\npurpose the council serves. Choosing this set of responsibilities may be more complicated than you imagine. What we are\\r\\nshooting for here is a council that members need to consult relatively rarely and only when\\r\\nthere’s no way around it. What we don’t want to do is to build an environment in which\\r\\nsomeone can’t scratch her leg without consulting the council.

Community process changes\\r\\nCouncils can drive changes to processes in your community and get those changes\\r\\naccepted. If you have a Community Council that is known to fairly represent the\\r\\ncommunity and they approve a process change, your community will feel like the process\\r\\nis now considered “official. ” As an example, in the Ubuntu community we changed the\\r\\nprocess in which developers applied to be a member of the project, and the Community\\r\\nCouncil needed to approve it. When it was approved, the community unequivocally\\r\\naccepted it. Ordaining governance bodies\\r\\nIf your community is large and requires multiple governance councils, your primary\\r\\nCommunity Council should be the body to make a proposed subcouncil official. As an\\r\\nexample, Ubuntu’s Community Council approved and officially nominated members for\\r\\nsubcouncils such as the Forums Council and IRC Council.

As\\r\\nan example, if you are a software project, your council may decide on the feature goals\\r\\nfor a given release targeting a given release date. This is a controversial topic in governance,\\r\\nand many communities vary in whether they allow a governing body to dictate features\\r\\nor their timing. In the Ubuntu community, a separate body called the Technical Board acts\\r\\nas an arbiter over debates concerning feature direction. While you are considering which responsibilities your council should take on, ask yourself how\\r\\nmuch impact these topics are going have on the day-to-day work in your community.

Let’s apply this to our Community Council for the Tobe project example. I think this would be\\r\\na suitable selection of privileges. TOBE COMMUNITY COUNCIL RESPONSIBILITIES\\r\\nThe Tobe Community Council (TCC) will govern the Tobe project by exercising the following\\r\\nresponsibilities:\\r\\n• Developer Approval—The TCC will judge applications for project developer positions. A\\r\\nprospective developer should present a wiki page that outlines his work in the Tobe project\\r\\nand lists at least two endorsements from current developers. The TCC will vote on the\\r\\napplication. •Process Changes—Any significant changes to community-wide processes should be approved\\r\\nby the TCC. • Governance Changes—Any changes to community governance (including the formation of\\r\\nnew governance bodies) should be approved by the TCC. • Conflict Resolution—If a member of the community has a conflict with other members that is\\r\\nhampering work and cannot be resolved, this issue can be raised to the TCC. The notice can\\r\\neither be given publicly in a meeting or be privately posted to the TCC mailing list. Any case\\r\\nput before the TCC should have as much externally referenced evidence as possible to\\r\\ndemonstrate the conflict. (You may notice that I have not included “Direction” in these responsibilities. I don’t believe that\\r\\ngoverned feature direction is necessary for a small community such as Tobe, because it could inhibit\\r\\ninnovation. )\\r\\nStructure\\r\\nWith our responsibilities in place, we now need to plan our council’s structure. While a council\\r\\nmay seem like fairly straightforward structure—a group of cooperating members—we need to\\r\\nconsider some important details. 330   CHAPTER TEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"c52c78f1-dda9-492e-8d61-c3469b63c4f6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"c52c78f1-dda9-492e-8d61-c3469b63c4f6\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"svb8NVqDaotcSDosmbRu+YYJEYpBjzFER+xEE+pPp90=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"My3EeuL9exg9EgmhdurPkroZoOmsNapUf9GzGY+Z6R4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"1d3531c1-ccb4-4eb5-bb4a-bcb7267e0a24\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"fV9rZJiiXBYhWbNIkZTixAJl4y16Wk/QSHAw1zOWIAc=\"}},\"hash\":\"u/zpYdoc9aCIcdi53jPQjjJcgYBH5E6j/+/63L5YRqE=\",\"text\":\"The first decision is how many members should be on the council.

In some communities, if the selection process for governing members repeatedly nets ineffective\\r\\nofficers the general feeling can be, “Well, that’s the way the community works and we just have to\\r\\ndeal with it. ”\\r\\nDon’t just deal with it. If your community governance is not working, change it so that it can work. In\\r\\ndoing this, it’s important not to single out and excoriate problematic members. A proposed\\r\\nmodification to council nomination or election should not be “David Foo is doing a terrible job, so\\r\\nhe should be banned from applying to the council in the future. ” Instead, you should build a system\\r\\nthat weeds out ineffective members quickly and averts their nomination in the first place. You can\\r\\nbase the system on experiences with current bad council members, but think in general terms. Criteria for excluding and removing council members could include a required level of participation,\\r\\naudits of how well the council works, and an agreed manifesto listing what members will work on. Each of these initiatives can help your community judge whether a member is effective. Finally,\\r\\ninstitute a process to review whether members should still be on the council.

Examples of this situation include the major Linux distributions: Ubuntu was founded and is\\r\\nmostly funded by Canonical Ltd., Fedora by Red Hat, and OpenSuSE by Novell.

Although the numbers are different, the Fedora and OpenSuSE approaches produce essentially\\r\\nthe same effect: a board in which 50% of the seats are reserved for the sponsor, one of whom\\r\\nis the chairperson with a tie breaking vote. This means that, conceivably, the sponsor could\\r\\npush through any issue they want: in OpenSuSE, the Novell staff could vote their majority,\\r\\nwhile in Fedora, there would be a deadlock of votes down the middle, allowing the chairperson\\r\\nto cast the deciding vote.

Membership\\r\\nWith a clear idea of your requirements and structure, the next step is to figure out what you\\r\\nare looking for in your council’s members. A council is nothing more than a collection of dependable people with a set of responsibilities. You need to depend on the members of your council to demonstrate maturity, competence,\\r\\nobjectivity, and sensitivity. Good council members are there not just for their personal\\r\\ncontributions and abilities, but because they can represent the needs of the community. After I gave a keynote on governance at the SoCal Linux Expo in Los Angeles, a chap came\\r\\nover and asked me what appeared to be a devilishly simple question:\\r\\nWhat kind of people should I look for to be on my community’s council? This got me thinking. Can we build a recipe for an excellent governing community member,\\r\\nand list the ingredients to look out for when choosing these members? Well, kind of. In my experience, community members come in many shapes and sizes. There\\r\\nis absolutely no commonality in terms of gender, race, career choice, technical experience, or\\r\\nage. You simply can’t look at someone on the street and determine that she is a great council\\r\\nmember. As we discussed earlier in the book, these checkboxes of surface-level diversity items\\r\\nwill not help you to build a great council. We instead need to look for deep-level attributes\\r\\nthat point to maturity and capability in governance. Fortunately, there is a common set of traits that you should be looking for. These ingredients\\r\\nwill indicate that someone has the chops for governing your community:\\r\\nWilling to listen\\r\\nGreat governors are always willing to listen. You will rely on your council members to\\r\\nlisten to your community and make sensible decisions based on hearing the full story.

Of course, everyone is biased in one way or another, but you need to shoot for council\\r\\nmembers who can do their best to put their biases to one side. A good test of this is if a\\r\\nprospective council member is open to changing her views based on further information. Another good sign is whether she is able to agree on a topic with someone whom she\\r\\ntypically disagrees with.

As such, the phone could be a better bet. NOTE\\r\\nOf course, if your community is small and local, there is no reason that meetings\\r\\ncan’t occur face-to-face in a local coffee shop or somewhere similar. Look at your\\r\\ncommunity and make a decision based on the norms of how it communicates. Whatever you decide, you should have regular meetings for your council. The purpose of these\\r\\nmeetings is to provide an opportunity for your community to engage with the body that\\r\\ngoverns it. As such, you should make it explicitly clear to your council members that they\\r\\nshould attend every meeting. A final note on communication is to make sure your community can add items to the council\\r\\nmeeting agenda in a simple and organized way. Your community needs to feel that they can\\r\\nraise topics on the council. I recommend having a public agenda visible so that (a) people can\\r\\nadd items to it and (b) others can see what items are planned for discussion and join in if it\\r\\ninterests them. A useful way to do this is to set up a wiki and simply ask people to update the agenda page\\r\\nwhen they want to discuss a topic.

Codifying Your Council\\r\\nWe are now a-rocking and a-rolling with a good idea of how our council is going to look. Throughout our discussion we have documented our decisions for our Tobe example, and you\\r\\nshould do the same for your own community. You can then gather these notes together and\\r\\ncombine them all into the same document. This process is known as codifying the council. When you have this document together, make it publicly visible. You can then use it as a\\r\\nstarting point to gather feedback from your community about the proposed council. Notify\\r\\nyour community and provide a simple way for them to provide feedback (such as updating a\\r\\nwiki page). This feedback provides an excellent opportunity to clarify any elements that are vague or\\r\\nincomplete in the document. It will also help you to engage with the community to ensure\\r\\nthat the governance structure is really supported and reflective of the needs of the wider\\r\\ncommunity. If you develop a Community Council plan in secret and in closed quarters, you\\r\\nwill find it incredibly difficult to push it through, and rightfully so.

All of your community members need to feel that they have the opportunity to be on the\\r\\ncouncil, but you also want to ensure that you maintain a high level of quality among your\\r\\ncouncil members. A common solution to this problem is to have an election in which your\\r\\ncommunity can vote for those who govern them. Unfortunately, the big misconception in community elections is that elections alone will\\r\\nsort the wheat from the chaff. In other words, many believe that if you have an open election,\\r\\nthe community will settle on the highest-quality candidates for the council. This is often not\\r\\nthe case. Popularity contests do not form great governance bodies. Someone without the maturity and\\r\\nvision you need may have a lot of friends and influence and snag a place on the council. On\\r\\nthe other hand, there may be a quiet and conscientious community member who is perfect for\\r\\na position in the council but never gets noticed. In fact, the most qualified community members\\r\\nhardly ever put themselves forward for a governing council, because they are too wrapped up\\r\\nin doing their work for the community. Fortunately, governments found long ago an effective\\r\\ncompromise between pure representative elections and top-down selection: a nomination\\r\\nprocess. Pull together the members you know well, who you feel are the current de facto leaders of the\\r\\ncommunity, and hold a meeting to nominate the appropriate people for a position on the\\r\\ncouncil.

As an example, if you have five seats on the council,\\r\\ntry to come up with seven or eight nominations. Each person should be an excellent candidate\\r\\nwho satisfies the criteria we discussed earlier.

A wiki is a great solution. You can then open up a vote. How you conduct this vote depends largely on how your\\r\\ncommunity is structured. As an example, if you have the concept of membership, such as\\r\\napproved members or approved developers, it is recommended that you allow only those\\r\\napproved contributors to vote. This will give all legitimate members of the community a voice,\\r\\nwhile ensuring that the decision is made by those who actually know the community well\\r\\nenough to offer an informed opinion. If your community is more loosely formed and just consists of anyone who joins a forum or\\r\\nmailing list, it is more suitable to nominate members from core contributors in the community. Ubuntu Governance Example\\r\\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed the requirements for governance, created a\\r\\nCommunity Council, explored the requirements for council members, and chosen the council’s\\r\\nmembers. As we said way back in Chapter 1, stories are the vessels of great best practices, and with\\r\\ngovernance such an important part of community growth, I want to devote a good chunk of\\r\\nthis chapter to an example of an open, transparent, and effective community that I have been\\r\\ninvolved in putting together: the Ubuntu community. This case study will give you a firm idea\\r\\nof how one large community has approached it, and the lessons learned. In the Beginning... In 2004, Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur, founded the Ubuntu project. A\\r\\nlongtime user, fan, and contributor to free software, he built his digital certificate company,\\r\\nGOVERNANCE   345\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"15419f71-eaa6-4bc2-8dcd-bc6100aebb2d":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"15419f71-eaa6-4bc2-8dcd-bc6100aebb2d\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"JBVydSw/vLPBwL/5Dzfnc/DUU3En8Mw+Q4nHCvCQ8tI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"7ENCiMdja3Pnxs7HGBWP/iePOimMRMjvh80dv1ebjZs=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8468d789-82fb-435b-bdc5-38666ebba00e\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"gS7ACJbg8M+P89cCfB+Qa4vryQAaw+bRcp5GbBB5F8g=\"}},\"hash\":\"ClM+p/Et4puYR0GgE2Kw575toBKSAOKdW1n0ZXMMsSI=\",\"text\":\"Thawte, on a Free Software foundation. When he sold his company to VeriSign, he made what\\r\\ncan only be described as a “rather large bucket of money. ”\\r\\nAfter spending a year in Russia training for a quick trip into space as the first South African\\r\\nspace tourist, Mark started laying plans for a new Linux distribution. At the time, distributions\\r\\nwere nothing new: Red Hat, Mandrake, Debian, and others were already producing\\r\\ncomprehensive operating systems that technical types such as myself were not only using, but\\r\\nwere also trying to convince our reluctant friends and family to use. Mark’s vision was different. First, he wanted to build Ubuntu on the excellent foundation of\\r\\nthe existing Debian distribution. To do this he hired some of the cream of the crop in the Debian\\r\\ncommunity, and they set to work to build a powerful and easy-to-use operating system. His\\r\\nvision did not end there, though. Mark not only wanted to promote an open source operating\\r\\nsystem, he also wanted to have the operating system be openly governed. Mark knew the\\r\\nimportance of community, and he knew the importance of transparency in a community. At the time, Linux distributions were going through something of an evolution. Linux was\\r\\nbeginning to enjoy real commercial interest from the widespread IT industry, and some of the\\r\\ntraditional Linux distributors, such as Red Hat and SuSE, were seeing serious adoption. Unfortunately, with all of these business interests, power lunches, and monetization, there was\\r\\na general feeling (at least as I remember it) that community was getting a little lost in the mix. This was not exactly surprising. The traditional IT industry was built on an understanding that\\r\\nprogrammers are hired to build your software, and that product managers make the decisions\\r\\nrequired to direct those programmers and deliver your product. Linux and open source were different: these companies had to understand that volunteers in\\r\\nbedrooms, basements, and universities had as much input in the direction and focus of that\\r\\nsoftware as anyone else. We now know that if these community members are welcomed and treated in a collaborative\\r\\nmanner, a company can net a huge amount of unpaid development. The buzzwords\\r\\ncrowdsourcing and peer production are widespread in the business world. Unfortunately, many\\r\\nof the companies jumping on the open source bandwagon back in 2004 failed to understand\\r\\nand embrace this community.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8468d789-82fb-435b-bdc5-38666ebba00e":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8468d789-82fb-435b-bdc5-38666ebba00e\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"JBVydSw/vLPBwL/5Dzfnc/DUU3En8Mw+Q4nHCvCQ8tI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"7ENCiMdja3Pnxs7HGBWP/iePOimMRMjvh80dv1ebjZs=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"15419f71-eaa6-4bc2-8dcd-bc6100aebb2d\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"ClM+p/Et4puYR0GgE2Kw575toBKSAOKdW1n0ZXMMsSI=\"}},\"hash\":\"gS7ACJbg8M+P89cCfB+Qa4vryQAaw+bRcp5GbBB5F8g=\",\"text\":\"Instead, they merely tolerated it as a politically correct nod to the\\r\\nwider open source community.

The Structure of the Ubuntu Community\\r\\nLike many open source communities, the Ubuntu project is not a democracy, but a meritocracy. Contributors are judged in the Ubuntu community on the basis of a significant and sustained\\r\\ncontribution. It is this simple rule of thumb that determines who takes a place in our community\\r\\nas well as our governance positions. Today, the Ubuntu community is broken into three approximate layers of governance, shown\\r\\nin Figure 10-1. FIGURE 10-1.

The community has been divided into four primary governing areas:\\r\\nMark Shuttleworth\\r\\nAs the founder and primary sponsor of Ubuntu, Mark is afforded the privilege of a tie\\r\\nbreaking vote and of deciding what his employees at Canonical focus their work on. Although “Mark Shuttleworth” appears at the top of Figure 10-1, the Community Council\\r\\nand Technical Board do not report to him; this is purely to illustrate his tie-breaking\\r\\nprivilege.

Tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorists could see this as\\r\\na means of Canonical enforcing its will on the community. Certainly from my experience, this\\r\\nis really not the case. Obviously every community functions best when it can reach broad consensus about a way\\r\\nforward. Collaborative discussion and decision making is always the desired approach in a\\r\\nvolunteer. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon in the open source world for there to be many\\r\\ngood arguments, and for arguments to divide communities rather than enrich them. The\\r\\nenergy that is focused on these circular debates would always be better spent creating solutions\\r\\nto problems. If there is a situation in which the community is deadlocked on a decision, with multiple valid\\r\\narguments for a given position, Mark can use his casting vote to unblock it.

The mandate of the Community Council is:\\r\\nThe social structures and community processes of Ubuntu are supervised by the Ubuntu\\r\\nCommunity Council. It is the Community Council that approves the creation of a new Team or\\r\\nProject, and appointment of team leaders. In addition, the Community Council is the body\\r\\nresponsible for the Code of Conduct and tasked with ensuring that maintainers and other\\r\\ncommunity members follow its guidelines. The way members are chosen is discussed in the section “Council or Board\\r\\nMember” on page 358. Its responsibilities are:\\r\\n•   Maintaining the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, which describes the standards of behavior\\r\\nexpected of Ubuntu maintainers and other community members. •Arbitrating disputes under the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. This will happen if a member of\\r\\nthe community has asked the Community Council to review the behavior of another\\r\\nmember in terms of the Code of Conduct (a document that every Ubuntu member is\\r\\nexpected to agree to that outlines basic levels of respectful collaboration). •   Team creation and appointment of team leaders. •   Creation of new structures and processes. A community member who wishes to create a\\r\\nnew structure or process submits a proposal to the Community Council for discussion and\\r\\napproval. The Community Council determines lines of reporting and responsibility\\r\\nbetween different community structures. The purpose of the Community Council is to provide a group of Ubuntu contributors who have\\r\\nexperience working in a range of teams in the community. This group is available to hear any\\r\\nissues, conflicts, or requests that the community would like to raise and request a verdict on. Each council member is expected to vote with a +1 (meaning “yes”) or a −1 (meaning “no”). A majority vote determines the decision of the Community Council. Importantly, whenever the Community Council sits to decide on an issue, there must be a\\r\\nquorum: that is, a minimum number of members present to form a majority vote for the body.

A limited set of subcouncils would be set up\\r\\nin parts of the project where repeated requests for governance were made. These councils\\r\\nwould then govern those areas of the community. One such example was the Ubuntu LoCo Teams. This worldwide community of 200+ local\\r\\nUbuntu user groups would get together to advocate Ubuntu, provide support, organize release\\r\\nparties, and more. As this part of the Ubuntu community continued to grow, its governance\\r\\nneeds heightened. Decisions about hosting, team naming, documentation, events, team\\r\\napprovals, and more were required. So the Community Council decided to form a LoCo\\r\\nCouncil that would tend to these decisions.

For some communities,\\r\\nmembership is merely taking an interest in what active members are doing, whereas other\\r\\ncommunities have a more formalized style of membership that requires some kind of approval\\r\\nprocess. In the Ubuntu community anyone is welcome to join and participate, and formalized\\r\\nmembership is not required. This ensures that the community is open for people to join and\\r\\ndip their toes in. This is great for people new to Ubuntu, but we do have some more formalized\\r\\nmembership roles for those who want to provide a more concrete level of contribution or those\\r\\nwho want to contribute to critical parts of the system that require approval. These roles are:\\r\\nUbuntu member\\r\\nThis is a basic level of approved membership that indicates that a contributor has provided\\r\\na reliable level of contribution.

Let’s now delve into each in\\r\\nmore detail. Ubuntu Member\\r\\nThis is the first level of formalized membership that someone would shoot for upon joining\\r\\nthe project. This role essentially guarantees that the contributor has demonstrated effective\\r\\nparticipation in a large distributed community such as Ubuntu. Each prospective member must\\r\\nsign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. To clarify what this role means, a mandate was defined at the inception of the project:\\r\\nMembership in the Ubuntu community recognizes participants for a variety of contributions,\\r\\nfrom code to artwork, advocacy, translations and organizational skills.

Although this level\\r\\nof membership does not guarantee quality of work, it does provide a fairly reliable baseline for\\r\\nengagement: it shows that the contributor has a history of providing sustained contributions\\r\\nto a community. This in itself is useful for a range of purposes, such as soliciting input, voting,\\r\\nencouraging participation in other parts of the project, and mentoring new community\\r\\nmembers. Users apply for membership through the following process:\\r\\n1. The user must have a profile on Launchpad, where people engage in Ubuntu work such\\r\\nas packaging, translations, bug triage, and more. 2. An application document is created on the Ubuntu wiki. This application should include\\r\\nsome standard items: a summary of contributions to Ubuntu, a link to the user’s\\r\\nLaunchpad profile, a complete description of contributions to Ubuntu, plans and ideas for\\r\\nUbuntu in the future, and testimonials of other Ubuntu Members who support the\\r\\napplication. 3. The user signs the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. This ensures that the contributor agrees to\\r\\nparticipate under positive rules of engagement in the community. The vast majority of\\r\\nreasonable and self-aware contributors automatically meet all of the criteria from the Code\\r\\nof Conduct. 4.The user then adds her application to the next Regional Membership Board meeting. There\\r\\nare three boards—Americas, Europe, and Asia—and each board votes on applications from\\r\\ntheir regions.

Before I wrap up this section, I want to share an important note: despite Canonical investing\\r\\nmillions of dollars each year in Ubuntu, this does not fast-track employees or step over any\\r\\nexisting community processes. I am an example of this. When I joined Canonical as the Ubuntu\\r\\ncommunity manager, I was expected to step before the Community Council, present my\\r\\napplication, and apply for Ubuntu membership. Fortunately I got it. It could have been a little\\r\\nweird if I didn’t! MEMBERSHIP EXPLOSION? SCALE IT UP! Traditionally, membership in the community was judged by the Ubuntu Community Council. As\\r\\nUbuntu continued to grow in popularity and the community grew at a similarly frantic pace, the\\r\\nCommunity Council found itself overstretched in its ability to keep up with applications. This is the reason the Regional Membership Boards were set up: they offered a more scalable\\r\\nsolution to the sheer growth of the project. Developer\\r\\nDevelopment is a critical part of Ubuntu. It is developers who take the thousands of open source\\r\\napplications and tools available online, package them, and make them available for easy\\r\\ninstallation and use on an Ubuntu system. These developers also fix bugs, deal with security\\r\\nissues, and ensure that these applications and tools integrate properly in the distribution. Anyone is welcome to apply for a developer role in the Ubuntu community. There is no\\r\\nrequirement to work at Canonical. In fact, many of the top-level developers who work on the\\r\\nmost significant parts of Ubuntu are volunteers. Having this level of openness has been a huge\\r\\nboon for transparency in the Ubuntu project, but it has also required a carefully thought-out\\r\\nprocess for assessing developers, in order to maintain packages’ standards of quality. These\\r\\nstandards of quality are equally applied to all prospective developers, regardless of whether\\r\\nthey work at Canonical. I’ll talk briefly about these developer roles as they exist at the time of this writing, but it should\\r\\nbe noted that we are currently going through something of a change and adjusting the\\r\\nprocesses behind these roles.

These changes are ongoing. Council or Board Member\\r\\nThe last type of membership role we will discuss here is that of a member on a governing body\\r\\nsuch as the Community Council, the Technical Board, or Forums Council. How did the Ubuntu\\r\\ncommunity approach identifying suitable community members for these different governance\\r\\nbodies? For most new councils, the primary council members are often handpicked to get the council\\r\\noff on a strong footing. This happened with the Community Council, Technical Board, and\\r\\nmost of the team councils, such as the Forums Council, IRC Council, and MOTU Council. Typically, the first generation of these councils is picked by the highest governing body. As an\\r\\nexample, the Community Council was formed by Mark Shuttleworth and the forefathers of\\r\\nUbuntu. Later councils, such as the Forums Council, had their initial members nominated by\\r\\nthe Community Council. When the council term ends, a new generation of members can be nominated. In most of these\\r\\ncases existing members are welcome to stand again for nomination, and there is an open call\\r\\nfor other contributors to propose themselves for membership in the body. Escalation\\r\\nEvery community has conflicts and other problems, and I devote Chapter 11 to these issues.

From tiny\\r\\nacorns great trees grow, and the branches of community often spread far and wide. We have seen this countless times, be it Ubuntu, Wikipedia, the Barack Obama campaign, or\\r\\nother communities you may have joined. When your community manages to captivate and\\r\\ndevelop mindshare, not only does the focus of the community grow but so does your\\r\\nmembership. More of these people want to be a part of the journey that your community is\\r\\non, and they often share the same passion and devotion to reaching the final destination as\\r\\nyou do. Although no one is going to quarrel with this growth, it can generate a headache: how on earth\\r\\ndo we scale up our governance bodies to manage this larger group of people?

It gets a lot ickier when there are Community Councils, team councils, delegated\\r\\nbodies, and other such pomp and grandeur.

Of course, many communities need multiple levels of councils, and we certainly discovered\\r\\nthat in the Ubuntu community. Despite its seeming complexity, I know that every piece in the\\r\\nUbuntu community is absolutely necessary, and that is our ethos here. Additional governance is required only when existing governance bodies are not able to scale\\r\\nor cater to your community’s requirements. Unfortunately, some communities don’t quite get\\r\\nthis right and decide to set up vanity councils: governing bodies that achieve nothing more\\r\\nthan making the members of the new council feel special. This can happen in the simplest of scenarios. As an example, imagine that the Tobe project that\\r\\nwe discussed earlier really took off and became the hot new thing. If it is like any other\\r\\nsuccessful community, a raft of additional resources will be created for the project. One typical\\r\\nexample would be discussion forums. When the forums go online, we would likely see the\\r\\nsame thing that has happened in other communities: a very passionate yet vocal community\\r\\nmakes its home in the forums. Although the Tobe Forums community may be small, the vocal few in the forums want to feel\\r\\nspecial: they want a governing council. In their eyes, governing councils bring all kinds of fun\\r\\nthings: a sense of control, authority, and power across the wider project. Not only this, but\\r\\nthey see a council as required for the community to be a real community. Nonsense. There is simply no reason for this council. The Tobe Community Council already exists as a\\r\\nplace to resolve issues, and the wider Tobe community is still fairly small.

The quantity of requests is the justification for the subcouncil: if you get only a few domain-\\r\\nspecific requests that your Community Council struggles to deal with, a separate council may\\r\\nnot be required, but if the council gets regular and repeated requests, it is worth considering. There are many examples where the issues just described resulted in the formation of councils. One such example, mentioned earlier, was the formation of the Ubuntu Membership Boards. In terms of expertise, the Community Council was capable of handling each membership\\r\\nrequest, but the sheer volume made it unfeasible. These three subcouncils were formed to\\r\\ncover the Americas, Europe, and Asia, and took over the responsibility of reviewing Ubuntu\\r\\nmembership requests.

Communicating Between Councils\\r\\nWhen I originally discussed how to build a new council, I stressed just how important it is that\\r\\nyou create communication channels for the council. This is an expected resource in each and\\r\\nevery council that your community puts together. It allows the council to share ideas,\\r\\ndeliberate on topics, and reach decisions. Friends, the communication love doesn’t end there, though. Now we must put our devious\\r\\nlittle minds to another opportunity: how can we help our multiple councils communicate with\\r\\none another? The reason and inspiration behind this shared cross-council communication are\\r\\nthose two magical words in community management: best practice. If you have two councils that are formed (e.g., a Community Council and a Forums Council),\\r\\nyou essentially have two groups of motivated, responsible, objective, and reliable people. Although each member on these councils should have a minimum level of suitability for the\\r\\ncouncil based on the attributes that we discussed earlier in this chapter, there is oodles of\\r\\npotential for these council members to learn from one another and further improve and refine\\r\\ntheir governance abilities. To do this, I recommend you set up an additional mailing list on which you ask every council\\r\\nmember in your community to be a member. I know, I know, you are probably getting a little\\r\\nsick of setting up all of these mailing lists, and I am by no means encouraging mailing list\\r\\nfetishism, but this cross-council list will be a valuable resource. Another added benefit of this\\r\\nlist is that it lets you address all of the governing members of your community in one place,\\r\\nwhich is helpful for sharing best practices.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8c1d22a8-c7d8-43c6-878c-9994c6a81511":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8c1d22a8-c7d8-43c6-878c-9994c6a81511\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"eSDnJdQGcb4inK6qwQqW8lHepcylNqscs/pNHRLkgZk=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"qYHs3IjAuMN/rXj2Meckwln+JHcN6C9cJyY4bJ0DjME=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8ddf0ad1-bb2f-4a66-ad66-34714e908905\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"p7Wa2Dmm/rclisFKuWK7mao23CjBwkwmobSWB9F3Le0=\"}},\"hash\":\"BI/ucVtSxd12QJVn0H/gMVMXUoxk/0qq30/2lBFvuWI=\",\"text\":\"Although it may seem a little less-than-transparent, I again recommend that this governance\\r\\nmailing list be a closed, members-only list with closed archives that only the current council\\r\\nmembers in your community can access.

Although you are welcome\\r\\nto submerge yourself in this academia, much of it will not be particularly useful when trying\\r\\nto figure out how to untwist the knickers of two people caught up in a fracas.

It will give you the\\r\\ntools for handling the level of conflict you are likely to deal with. The Structure of Strife\\r\\nLet’s kick off the chapter by exploring some of the high-level elements involved in conflict. The following are three fundamental ingredients that are often present in a conflict:\\r\\nConfident/free-thinking personalities\\r\\nTypically the participants in the conflict are not exactly wallflowers. They are often strong\\r\\npersonalities who are not afraid to speak up when they are unhappy. Incompatible goals/values\\r\\nThere are invariably one or more goals or values that the participants disagree on. Importantly, these are typically perceived goals and values. The reality is often very\\r\\ndifferent, as we will explore later in this chapter. Interaction\\r\\nThe fact that two strong personalities disagree on goals or values does not in itself cause\\r\\nconflict; it is the manner in which these personalities interact that causes the sparks to fly. The source and nature of the interaction is often a key component in the conflict. Conflict is a little like really bad food. There are many strong flavors out there (these are our\\r\\npersonalities), and many of them have distinctive purposes (these are our goals/values). When\\r\\nthe ingredients are in their boxes and bottles in your kitchen cupboard, they are innocent and\\r\\ninnocuous. However, putting them together in the same dish can potentially create something\\r\\nthat leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth for a long time.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"39f4d419-a7e0-45fb-8f89-b37b6d8dd736":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"39f4d419-a7e0-45fb-8f89-b37b6d8dd736\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"aWtYFoc/MsewHyG/TlXkVzcsnc/OrxdK72Co2asxOXU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"FR5pWyaddRzfVhK9NI3XhH8oHuBZn9g4UdFvcKBZ5QU=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"e614e3ad-1656-4b83-95a6-eedced248184\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YS3ysmtclr5dAAdtrREKKQ4TUMUzyUxZsNHWvXInKk4=\"}},\"hash\":\"4BTy0m/7Xa6bYJE4Iy0MULZWDpe0oOlVJUpldTJuspU=\",\"text\":\"On the other hand, strong flavors\\r\\nput together in the right way can complement one another and produce stunning outcomes\\r\\nand tastes that become memorable, long-lasting, and incredibly enjoyable.

Conflict is always going to be present in a thriving community, and strangely it\\r\\nis one metric of success. This reminds me of an incident that happened a few years back when I wrote a blog entry on\\r\\nhttp://www.jonobacon.org/ and received an awfully mean-spirited and nasty comment: personal,\\r\\nfull of vitriol, and entirely unnecessary. As soon as I read it I became very self-reflective and\\r\\nworried that the statement may have represented the views of more than that individual. In\\r\\ndoing so, I entirely failed to balance the picture and consider the countless pleasant comments\\r\\nand wonderful email that I received. My mind zoned in on the negative. In the midst of all of this, I logged on to discover a message from my friend Christian Schaller:\\r\\nHey Jono. I saw that comment on your blog, you must be delighted! When I asked in what possible dimension that comment would make me happy, Christian\\r\\nresponded with:\\r\\nFor someone to write that it means that they care what you think, so much so they felt the need\\r\\nto write it on your website.

As a community leader, your community will look to you for guidance and advice when\\r\\nconflict rears its ugly head. You need to be prepared to step in and provide security and\\r\\nconfidence. You need the skills to handle conflict in a way that is professional and reasoned,\\r\\nand subscribes to the underlying values of your community.

If you can see and detect these indicators, you have the opportunity\\r\\nto step in before the going really gets rough. Although every community is different, many of these warning signs are shared across all\\r\\ncommunities. Let’s now take a spin through some of these indicators of a conflict on the\\r\\nhorizon. As we explore these topics, we will end each discussion with a quick and dirty set of\\r\\npreventive bullet points that you can jot down to help avoid these issues in the first place. Contentious Personalities\\r\\nOne of the most delightful attributes of community is its ability to energize and enable people. Without having any prior experience or reputation, many go on to develop expertise and\\r\\nrespect by starting at the beginning and leveraging the opportunity of community to do\\r\\namazing things. One underlying attribute that makes this possible is the openness involved in\\r\\ncommunity: everyone in a volunteer community is welcome to join and participate. With such\\r\\nopenness as the norm, the exceptions to the rule—when people who actually get rejected from\\r\\na community—are usually those who perform gross misconduct that socially disappoints the\\r\\nwider community. Thankfully these kinds of incidents are rare. If we draw a conceptual line that puts the ideal polite and engaged contributor on the far left\\r\\nof the line and the frustrating, imbecilic clod on the far right, there is a significant scale in\\r\\nbetween where the vast majority of your contributors will find their home.

Let’s first look at some of the reasons why\\r\\npeople may appear vexing to others:\\r\\nAge\\r\\nAlthough many will deny it, age can dramatically affect how people engage in community. This can vary from methods of communication (younger people often shorten and codify\\r\\ntheir language, such as with “txtspeak” and “lolspeak”) to different values, perspectives,\\r\\nopinions, and approaches. In many cases younger people are more trigger-happy,\\r\\nadventurous, and argumentative than older people, and this can be a prominent source\\r\\nof conflict. As many people get older, they become “set in their ways” and less likely to\\r\\nchange and reflect on their views. Although this naturally does not affect everyone, it does\\r\\napply to many. Culture\\r\\nWith so many communities living online and garnering an international audience, culture\\r\\ncan play a big role. This can affect temperament, preparedness, approach, and other\\r\\nelements. Culture can be a subtle contributor to conflict: often these differences are\\r\\ndifficult to spot unless you are intimately familiar with both cultures. This is also a sensitive\\r\\ntopic, as the acknowledgment of cultural differences can often be wrongly interpreted as\\r\\nracism. Tread carefully, Obi-Wan. Opinions\\r\\nIt is interesting how some people just seem to have more opinions than others. These\\r\\npeople can be both a blessing and a curse. If you put two of these opinion-laden folks\\r\\ntogether, things can get fiery quickly. The subtlety here is not in whether someone has an\\r\\nopinion but in how constructively that person can express it. Experience\\r\\nThe level of each person’s knowledge of the subject and the community itself can play a\\r\\nhuge part in conflict issues. Sometimes those with more experience in the community\\r\\nexpect those with less experience to know more, and consequently frustration builds. Not good. The interesting commonality among all these attributes is that people can and have been\\r\\nknown to mature in each area. Understanding this maturity can be the key to understanding\\r\\nyour wider community and its personal development better.

In other words, your\\r\\ncommunity should always feel that their input is welcome. It may not be acted on, but it should\\r\\nbe received in good faith.

Problems with Responsibility\\r\\nEvery community contains groups of people who have clear and perceived responsibilities.

The first is having too many eggs in one basket. This is when a single person has too much\\r\\nresponsibility and control over a given part of the community. This can happen a lot with\\r\\nresource management. It is common to have one person as the single point of contact for\\r\\nadministering mailing lists, accounts, forums, or other resources. This is all fine and dandy\\r\\nwhen that person can keep up with the maintenance requests, but when that falters, frustration\\r\\nfollows closely after. This ties into the second issue: responsiveness, a problem that has plagued every community. The reason is fairly obvious when you consider it: community leaders are typically highly\\r\\nmotivated, fidgety people who have no problem keeping themselves occupied. Busy people\\r\\ntend to become really busy people, and it is not uncommon for them to take on a little too\\r\\nmuch. Too many responsibilities and not enough time is a recipe for further community\\r\\nfrustration. NOTE\\r\\nRemember that you could be a bottleneck, too. If you find that your TODO list is\\r\\nspiraling out of control, it is likely you are a bottleneck. Check which items are\\r\\nblocking on you, and try to spread them out to more people. If left untended, these issues can cause wider annoyance and even nastiness. This happened\\r\\nin a community in which I played a loose role a few years back.

While there are many causes for conflict, your community\\r\\nwill depend on its leaders to unblock conflict and restore order. When this happens, all conflict\\r\\nfeels temporary and manageable. If your community loses faith in its leader’s ability to unblock\\r\\nand resolve these problems, it can feel as if the earth is shaking. It can make the community\\r\\nfeel like a lawless state in which agitation and arguments reign supreme. This is obviously not\\r\\na good position to be in.

If the conflict is private,\\r\\nthose who claim that conflict was not resolved may simply be unaware that it was resolved. In many cases you can settle any concerns by dropping a quick email to the concerned members\\r\\nto let them know the situation was handled and resolved. TIPS FOR AVOIDING CONFLICT\\r\\n•    Always deal with conflict. Never leave issues languishing or unresolved. •    In public conflict, ensure that you are seen to be acting. Provide input,\\r\\nfeedback, and reassurance in public communication channels. Justice must be\\r\\ndone and it must be seen to be done. •    Always be responsive to concerns. PHYSICAL VIOLENCE: NEVER ACCEPTABLE\\r\\nIt goes without saying that violence is never acceptable in your community. While it is rare, you\\r\\nmust be prepared to take a zero-tolerance view in case it does happen. If someone is violent to\\r\\nanother member, make it clear that (a) the attacker must leave the community, (b) you will inform\\r\\nthe authorities, and (c) the attacker will be able to rejoin the community after he has cooled down\\r\\nand demonstrated that he will never again resort to such behavior. Informing the authorities—which includes the police as well as the leaders of institutions you’re\\r\\ninvolved with, such as universities—is important for several reasons. First, violent people tend to\\r\\nescalate their behavior imperceptibly, and law enforcement can benefit from seeing patterns of\\r\\nescalating behavior so that they can ward off real danger. Second, you need to protect your\\r\\ncommunity against legal retaliation, because violent people often turn around and invent charges\\r\\nagainst their victims. Another subtle point is that you consider very carefully whether you should mention that violence\\r\\nis never tolerated. For many, the merest mention of the topic is so obvious that it can be interpreted\\r\\nas patronizing. This really depends on your community. For example, it is undoubtedly going to be\\r\\nmore acceptable to mention this topic in an urban regeneration community as opposed to a local\\r\\nneighborhood knitting group.

What I am going to present here is a broad description of steps I generally use to deal with\\r\\ncontentious issues. These steps map out the primary elements involved in conflict resolution,\\r\\nand you can build on them to form your own style. Interestingly, while I was reading some of the many books about conflict resolution, I\\r\\ndiscovered a theory developed by Johnson & Johnson in 1994. I have been living and practicing\\r\\nthis approach to conflict resolution for years without realizing it had a name. I was all set to\\r\\ncall it Bacon’s Great Conflict Resolution Theory when I discovered that those pesky Johnsons got\\r\\nin there first. Regardless of who coined the theory, it is a practical, real, and directly usable approach for\\r\\ncommunities. Let’s take a look at Johnson & Johnson’s approach:\\r\\n1. Collect data—Learn what the conflict is about, and develop an objective picture of all\\r\\nparties’ perspectives. 2. Probe—Ask open questions, listen, and engage with all parties to get the full story. 3.Save face—Work toward a winning resolution for everyone, and try to avoid embarrassing\\r\\neither party while always remaining objective and unemotional. 4.Discover common interests—Finding common interests and alliances will help find points\\r\\nof commonality beneath the conflict. 5.Reinforce—Where both parties share a perspective and agree, reinforce those perspectives,\\r\\nand particularly try to use data to back it up. 6. Negotiate—Start simple, trying to get both parties to agree on simple solutions, and then\\r\\ncontinue to build toward the common goals of both parties involved. 7. Solidify adjustments—Review, summarize, and confirm the areas in which both parties\\r\\nagree. Each step is performed one at a time.

This is the role of the facilitator (also\\r\\nknown as a mediator). A facilitator can’t be just anyone: she must secure the trust and confidence of the warring\\r\\nparties. The parties involved need to have faith that the facilitator is going to take a fair,\\r\\nreasoned, and thorough approach to the conflict. The probability that the conflict will be resolved is hugely dependent on this faith. With this\\r\\nin mind, let’s spend some time looking at the profile of a great facilitator. This can give you\\r\\nsome food for thought for your own role as a facilitator. Be objective\\r\\nObjectivity is the foundation of all effective conflict resolution. As we discussed earlier, you\\r\\nneed to build faith in the participants. To do this, you need to build faith in the wider\\r\\ncommunity that you can act in an entirely objective fashion. This raises a difficult question,\\r\\nthough: how do you demonstrate objectivity in your community yet still offer opinions and\\r\\ndirection? To remain objective, do you need to never express your own opinion? Not at all. Objectivity does not spring from remaining aloof and above the fray, but in the way\\r\\nyou engage in discussions and topics. This is all about how you interact with the community. There are a few simple best practices that can help communicate your objectivity to the\\r\\ncommunity:\\r\\nBe honest\\r\\nThere is no such thing as an objective but dishonest person. If your community doesn’t\\r\\ntrust you, they won’t believe in your ability to be objective. As such, be honest at all times,\\r\\nprivately and publicly. Admit when you are wrong\\r\\nSometimes you are going to get it wrong...in public. Instead of denying any mistakes or\\r\\nwithering behind a wall of silence, put your head above the pulpit and admit when you\\r\\nget it wrong. This is an extension of being honest, and your community will respect you\\r\\nfor it. Don’t wear the flame suit\\r\\nEvery community has flame wars, that is, the arguments and disagreements that happen\\r\\non mailing lists, websites, blogs, and elsewhere. Don’t get involved. Participating in the\\r\\nflame wars causes you harm in two ways.

Of course,\\r\\nthere is a balance to be struck here: don’t turn your role as facilitator into that of a stand-up\\r\\ncabaret comedian, but a few subtle, amusing references here and there will ensure that\\r\\neveryone stays as positive as possible. Be open\\r\\nI am going to let you in on a little secret. The word open irritates me. Well, let me be clearer:\\r\\nthe overuse of the word open irritates me, and in recent years the word seems to be more\\r\\nprevalent than a furball in an animal shelter. When used within the context of conflict resolution, a valuable application of openness is to\\r\\nseek equality with all participants in the conflict and thus avoid cliques and in-jokes. Some years back, I was observing a friend of mine dealing with a conflict situation who\\r\\nmanaged to violate this goal of equality and openness. He did this by engaging differently with\\r\\none of the participants: he knew that person more personally and referred to various in-jokes\\r\\nand private references. Rather unsurprisingly, the other person (who was just as bemused\\r\\nabout the in-jokes as I was) felt he never had a shot at an objective judgment. Don’t make the\\r\\nsame mistakes yourself. Be organized when you put your feet firmly into the shoes of a facilitator. Make sure to\\r\\nschedule calls and meetings at times you can adhere to; under no circumstances should you\\r\\nsimply skip meetings or stop responding to email. Timeliness is key. KEEP RECORDS\\r\\nAlways document what happens during conflict resolution. Get permission to preserve emails and\\r\\nother communications from all parties. Write down notes from sessions. In this way, you can refer\\r\\nback to previous communications when people dispute the facts.

This was a step forward: both Alan and Lee agreed that the need to handle money in\\r\\nsome way was required. The next part of the discussion was to cover typical activities requiring money. Was this a small\\r\\namount of money for printing and CD duplication, or was it a larger expense for equipment\\r\\nand travel? Consensus struck again with agreement that costs would be for small to medium-\\r\\nsize expenses, the most costly being a few nights in a hotel and a train ticket. At this point in the discussion, there was a general atmosphere of agreement in the call. Both\\r\\nAlan and Lee were loosening up and more pleasant with each other, and the growing sense of\\r\\nagreement was having an impact. As the call progressed, we edged further and further toward\\r\\nagreement on a series of different issues. After a few more small steps forward, the time was\\r\\nup. I reiterated our progress and we all agreed to have a wider meeting on the money-handling\\r\\ntopic with the community. A week later, the community meeting kicked off, and I shared some of the agreements that\\r\\nAlan and Lee had formed. We then moved forward to discuss how donations would be handled,\\r\\nand the community agreed on PayPal. The next step was to discuss the crux of the issue: who\\r\\nwould look after the money. Alan and Lee each expressed their perspectives in turn and other\\r\\ncommunity members weighed in. A number of community members expressed concern over\\r\\na full governance solution to handling money, and naturally Alan reiterated his views on the\\r\\nmatter while Lee and some others provided their opposing views. To find a middle ground, I proposed that instead of a full governing body to look after the\\r\\nmoney, Lee (who had been the primary champion of a money management facility in the\\r\\ngroup) would handle the funds but provide open accounting of the funds. I also recommended\\r\\nregular meetings with the group about how the money was being handled. Furthermore, I\\r\\noffered Lee the task of investigating what we would need to do to satisfy the local tax\\r\\nrequirements. The group unilaterally agreed. Bingo! This tentative and fragile agreement was the victory\\r\\nthat we could build on to later reach a firmer sense of agreement and consensus.

After each\\r\\nmeeting, I emailed them with a summary of what we agreed and the total set of agreements. The act of documenting our progress and sharing it fostered a real sense of progress. Part 5: Reflect and maintain\\r\\nThe final part of the conflict resolution process is twofold: to maintain progress on the agreed-\\r\\nupon outcomes and to encourage a general sense of personal development in the members of\\r\\nthe conflict. The former goal is an exercise in keeping your wheels on the road. Just because you have a\\r\\nset of written, agreed-upon outcomes doesn’t mean anyone is going to stick with them. Don’t\\r\\nhold the members’ hands as they execute the outcomes, but check in every so often and ensure\\r\\nthat everything is running smoothly. This can often be as simple as a quick email to each party\\r\\nto see how things are going. To ensure that you don’t forget, it’s often useful to put it in your\\r\\ncalendar for a few weeks’ time. The second element is subtle yet important. In many cases of conflict, the participants often\\r\\nbecome very reflective at a later date. Many will review their actions and their conduct, and\\r\\nwhile they will remain resolute in some of their opinions, they may also express regret at how\\r\\nthey handled certain situations. These reflective lessons are valuable, and your community needs reinforcement when they\\r\\nhappen. To see why, think back to when you have made your own reflections on your life. When someone has been by your side to cheer you on, it gives you much more determination\\r\\nto be consistent in the change.

Dealing with Burnout\\r\\nSo far in this chapter we have explored the importance of conflict, the different elements of\\r\\nthe conflict resolution process, and how to step through it.

Burnout refers to long-term\\r\\nexhaustion that typically causes lack of interest and focus. Unfortunately, it can be devilishly\\r\\ndifficult to spot and prevent in your community. Burnout appears as a series of often subtle changes in personality, perspective, values, and\\r\\nbehavior in the sufferer. As these changes progress, it can be difficult to identify that members\\r\\nare suffering from burnout. Unfortunately, burnout often is misdiagnosed as irrationality, short\\r\\ntemperament, unusual and strange behavior, lack of tolerance, or for the ladies out there,\\r\\naccusations of “the wrong time of the month. ”\\r\\nWhile it is difficult to identify categorically, fortunately there is some compelling research that\\r\\nwas first published in the June/July 2006 issue of Scientific American in an article called “Burned\\r\\nOut.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2e8621d5-c4b8-4b0c-be9b-dcc36c3b2fa8":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2e8621d5-c4b8-4b0c-be9b-dcc36c3b2fa8\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"fRW+rj/D9c/6+QC5SEVFYoHvD4YPnlLpw1a5/188AbU=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"OxSMsFU37SyFMIBqQTBZwcO4lSd4S0tN0MtLv1iIxzQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"1164922d-fd93-4336-bd88-7290760c1797\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"9i1cS0U0IYDy/TogyC25Lh6wfmCuBjrBnyr4tToRlfw=\"}},\"hash\":\"my0ZlGloSdQs25DX0ythVaG97s9wfJdnAMX3SpUPI4M=\",\"text\":\"” It presented the findings of two psychologists, Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North,\\r\\nand their Burnout Cycle.

This can include going on vacation, having\\r\\nchildren, taking some time away from the community to decompress, and so on. Gradual\\r\\nSome community members will gradually reduce their involvement as time goes on\\r\\nwithout any notice or intent to give notice.

This can be caused by a new\\r\\nrelationship (someone falls head over heels in love and vanishes for a while to live his life\\r\\nto the soundtrack of Dirty Dancing), a blowout with someone in the community, or an\\r\\nillness; unfortunately, sometimes people vanish for unknown reasons. In your community you always want to strive to be able to plan for absence and identify ways\\r\\nto fill in the gaps where possible. As such, you should always encourage a culture in which\\r\\nyour community members inform one another when they are going away for a while (or for\\r\\ngood). You should also encourage a culture of leaders stepping down gracefully (this is\\r\\nsomething we have done in Ubuntu as part of our Code of Conduct, and it has worked well).

It can also be a\\r\\nsurprisingly heartwarming time, as your community pulls together like a family to console and\\r\\nsupport one another. In 2011, a member of the Ubuntu community died; he was called Andre. He was a prominent\\r\\nand active member of the Brazilian community and was a popular and well-loved friend to\\r\\nthose who knew him. Unfortunately, Andre had been suffering from some health issues for\\r\\nsome time, and many people didn’t know about this as he kept these challenges to himself. He\\r\\ndied the week of one of our Ubuntu Developer Summits. I had not handled the death of a community member before. I made sure to mark his memory\\r\\nand his wonderful contributions to our community, but to also not tell people how they should\\r\\ngrieve; I believe grief is a very personal journey. To find this balance I decided to hold a minute\\r\\nof silence in the closing ceremony of the summit and put up a big picture of Andre. Another\\r\\nmember of the community also organized a book so that people could write their condolences\\r\\nand memories for Andre’s family. Although this was a sad time, the way the community came together to support one another,\\r\\ncelebrate Andre’s memory, and be there for one another as a family was a memorable and\\r\\nwarming experience.

It is as old as the world itself, and countless generations of people just\\r\\nlike you have learned how to deal with contentious issues before you.

Communities that instill a sense of\\r\\nbelonging in their members are, by definition, mature and capable. Those who belong feel\\r\\nproductive and empowered, and they form the firm foundation of your community. Although many of the workflow approaches we have covered in this book will build a sleek,\\r\\nefficient, and effective community, the impact of these approaches on belonging is primarily\\r\\nby association. When you have smooth processes and infrastructure in your community, it\\r\\nmakes the community feel effortless, and it makes your community members feel productive. When they are productive and enjoy the fruits of their labor, a sense of belonging begins to\\r\\ndevelop. Great communities are built on great relationships. When people really feel a sense of belonging\\r\\nthey are enjoying not only being productive but also swimming in the tide of your community’s\\r\\npersonality. When you put productive people together in a room (real or virtual) and they feel\\r\\na sense of family, your community will be inundated with belonging. Family is the operative word here. Many of us traditionally feel it from our experiences with\\r\\nour parents and siblings, but we feel it elsewhere, too.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"8b70e529-e48d-417d-80d7-ef8e199091cd":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"8b70e529-e48d-417d-80d7-ef8e199091cd\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"QCWYb4UKZm3Je/x9J2M5lsVAxr7HcTQdNNOZhv0k8Dc=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"UFw6NkvTnlqYJC5ikCAmyIe22RxLUBoXoN0QqapvnXM=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"4e2c2aa5-3837-4645-a1ea-9eedb1da918c\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"07sLKrHH7J84XQySd9vIODrzijbOZXbmcZykDzG/Wdw=\"}},\"hash\":\"5EBU5GXsrZy+oi/0+1GrV1dJqf3EbjQ4yaC629kf6a0=\",\"text\":\"Many will feel a sense of family in their\\r\\nlocal bars and restaurants, at their school or college, in coffee shops, and elsewhere.

Everyone I have ever spoken to\\r\\nregarding event organization has always learned the hard way that being organized is the only\\r\\nway to ensure that all of your plans land on the ground running. Getting a detail wrong can\\r\\nundermine the entire event. For example, you may have a perfectly laid out conference but\\r\\nforget to get signs made with directions to the different rooms, so people struggle to find the\\r\\nlocation of the talks they are interested in. Step 1: Identify Requirements\\r\\nYou need to choose which kind of event you would like to organize and then identify which\\r\\nsteps are involved. We will defer discussion of these steps until a little later when we delve into\\r\\nthe different needs for various physical and online events. When you have an idea of these needs, write them down and flesh out an action plan for\\r\\ncarrying out that specific component. As an example, if one of those items is accommodation,\\r\\nyou should note each step involved in sourcing accommodation. Step 2: Find Help\\r\\nThe next step is to find people to help you organize the event. This is particularly important\\r\\nfor physical events. For smaller events, such as small sprints, you may not require much help,\\r\\nbut for larger events, such as conferences and summits, you will definitely need help. For physical events it helps to find people in your community who are happy to look after\\r\\nspecific roles. Here are some of the role divisions that may apply to the events you run (not all\\r\\nwill apply to every event):\\r\\nAccommodation\\r\\nThis person organizes the hotel options and reservations. Sponsorship\\r\\nIf you are seeking sponsorship for the event, you should have a single point of contact to\\r\\ndeal with the sponsors. Merchandise\\r\\nIf you have t-shirts, lanyards, and other items that need to be arranged, this person\\r\\norganizes these. Speaker liaison\\r\\nThis person will work to find and schedule speakers. This person also manages the\\r\\nscheduling of speakers.

When you have these roles identified and filled, you should organize regular meetings where\\r\\norganizers update one another on their progress in organizing the event and discuss further\\r\\nwork and any problems. I recommend that you hold these meetings every two weeks at first, and in the two months\\r\\nleading up to the event, accelerate the meetings to be held weekly. I also recommend that you\\r\\norganize conference calls, if possible, to host the meetings, although an online chat medium\\r\\nwill also work. NOTE\\r\\nHere I have listed only the roles that apply to physical events. Physical events are\\r\\nalways much more complicated to organize than their online counterparts: there\\r\\nare a lot more components to figure out, and many of these components rely on\\r\\noutside parties, such as hotels, catering companies, equipment providers, and\\r\\nmore. Although you can divide online event organization into roles, too, online\\r\\nevents typically require far less work and can be organized by a single person. If you find that your event is too much to handle for a single person, though, do\\r\\nbreak it into roles in a similar way. Step 3: Set Deadlines\\r\\nThis is what I consider the most valuable step of all in organizing your event. You should look\\r\\nat the range of components in your event planning and produce a set of deadlines that provide\\r\\nplenty of time to achieve those tasks. Imagine you are organizing a conference. For each major task listed in the previous section,\\r\\nyou should prepare a set of deadlines. As an example, these could be some deadlines for the\\r\\nprocess of opening up a call for papers, choosing proposals, and announcing the final decided\\r\\nlist of speakers:\\r\\n•   February 23—Begin planning Call for Papers and put together website form for\\r\\nsubmissions. •   March 9—Open up the event’s Call for Papers and publicize. •   April 13—Announce “One week left! ” for the Call for Papers. •   April 20—Call for Papers closes.

A great solution to this is to set up a shared calendar on a service such as Google\\r\\nCalendar and ensure that each organizer has access. Step 4: Make Time\\r\\nThe world is becoming an increasingly busy place, and time is an ever-rarer resource. You are\\r\\na busy person, too: you are involved in your community; you are working to improve, enrich,\\r\\nand inspire; and you have your own set of tasks and responsibilities to look after. With so much\\r\\ngoing on, making the commitment to run an event can be daunting.

Leslie also has some words of wisdom on this topic:\\r\\n“People generally underestimate the amount of time it will take to get things done, even when there\\r\\nare many hands to help with planning and execution. I’ve found this situation to be especially true\\r\\nthe day of an event; folks often don’t leave themselves enough time for setup and attendees are left\\r\\nstanding around waiting for the party to really get started. “Folks also tend to assume that a larger group of folks organizing logistics is better, but I’ve found\\r\\nthis scenario only holds true when you have one or two charismatic folks giving direction to the rest\\r\\nof the organizing team. Without clear instruction, people tend to get distracted by less important\\r\\ndetails or talking with friends, and a great organizer knows both how to detect these lags early (and\\r\\noften) and how to politely refocus efforts on the task at hand. “Also, your event managers need to remain available to direct traffic rather than jumping into the\\r\\nfray until the finishing touches are required; shifting focus from directing to doing can leave some\\r\\nfolks unclear on what should happen next, particularly when they’re in a brand-new location and\\r\\nare unfamiliar with how best to utilize the space or a venue’s processes for setup, etc. When people\\r\\naren’t sure what to do, this leads to distraction for those team members who are focused on a\\r\\nparticular task. As tempting as it is to jump in and help when managing an event, it’s best to hold\\r\\nback and make sure the organizing team feels empowered to get things done and clearly\\r\\nunderstands what’s expected of them. ”\\r\\nTime is an important resource.

Release parties\\r\\nRelease parties celebrate the release of something. These parties are common in the\\r\\nsoftware, movie, and gaming worlds.

Some release events are fuller and\\r\\nincorporate presentations, workshops, and other features. Each type of event is composed of broadly the same ingredients: a group of people meeting at\\r\\nthe same venue to do something. The way they differ is in the focus of the event, be it working\\r\\ntogether (sprint), discussing ideas (summit), sharing knowledge (conference), coming together\\r\\nto meet like minds (cons), or celebrating something (release parties).

Here you should think imaginatively: consider some\\r\\nless obvious venues as suitable options. As an example, when we were organizing\\r\\nLugRadio Live in the United Kingdom, we considered options such as bars, music venues,\\r\\nand outdoor events. Unfortunately, desirable choices for many of the other items on this\\r\\nlist tend to require a high-cost location, because that’s the kind of location near airports,\\r\\nnice restaurants, and so on. A subtle consideration when choosing a venue is how your audience will perceive it. As an\\r\\nexample, if you run a business community, you may want to choose a venue that is more\\r\\nprofessionally oriented, such as a business center or hotel conference facility. If your\\r\\ncommunity is more low-key, you will have more flexibility with venue choice. When I was involved in organizing LugRadio Live, a loose, social, and informal event that was\\r\\npart of our LugRadio podcast, we discounted many venues due to the “feel. ” We were explicitly\\r\\nlooking to achieve a social environment for the show, and many available places didn’t fit,\\r\\nincluding university lecture theaters and hotel conference facilities. We instead chose student\\r\\nunion bars, independent theaters, and football stadium facilities: the latter all immediately\\r\\nexpressed a more social and fun feel than the former. Another consideration is the venue’s environmental impact on the mood of the event. When\\r\\nwe organized the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville, Spain, the venue was in a large\\r\\nunderground conference facility in a hotel. There were no windows, making the summit feel\\r\\nmore constrained and causing people to tire earlier. The lack of windows meant attendees could\\r\\nnot see daylight, and as such could not judge the time of day as the light changed.

Another benefit of knowing these numbers\\r\\nis that if you have an outright success on your hands and are likely to have many more people\\r\\nattending, you can make preparations to deal with the increased traffic at the event. It is important to remember, though, that conference preregistration figures often don’t reflect\\r\\nthe final attendance, particularly for events that are free or where people can pay at the door.

For a daytime event, this is\\r\\nmost typically lunch and breaks. If it is an evening event, the catering is usually dinner and\\r\\ndrinks. Catering can make the cost of the event balloon, so you need to consider it carefully. An added\\r\\ncomplication is that many venues will restrict you to using only their on-site kitchen or a\\r\\nspecific vendor. You should check this when investigating the venue. Such locked-in vendors\\r\\nusually lead to outrageously inflated costs, but you can’t really blame the venue, because it\\r\\nhas its own advantages in maintaining a relationship with a vendor who gets to know it well.

Regardless of what you decide, it is\\r\\nhighly recommended that you have drinks available: people get thirsty throughout the day,\\r\\nparticularly if there is lots of discussion.

Bear in mind that the\\r\\nsprint is intended to be a working session, and therefore you may need facilities for this\\r\\nwork, such as Internet access, plenty of power outlets, and tables and chairs. For a small\\r\\nsprint the venue can be informal and loose, with many communities sprinting in houses\\r\\nand apartments. Accommodation\\r\\nThere are no special accommodation requirements for sprints. Equipment\\r\\nThe equipment requirements depend on the type of work you will be doing. As an\\r\\nexample, if you are doing software development, people should bring their own laptops,\\r\\nbut you may want to provide blank media, commonly requested cables, power strips, USB\\r\\nstorage devices, and so on. Date/time\\r\\nThe length of the sprint should reflect how long you can reasonably expect people to be\\r\\ntogether. Do remember that people will need to book time off work to be there, and some\\r\\nmay be away from their families and children. I recommend that a sprint range from three\\r\\nto five days. I do not recommend a sprint that lasts longer than a week. Cost\\r\\nTo the best of your ability, sprints should be free. You should seek to cover your costs with\\r\\nsponsorship if your organization can’t pony up the funds itself. Registering attendance\\r\\nYou will want to get a firm idea of who is coming, but also make the sprint open so that\\r\\nanyone is welcome to attend. Specialist sprints will require specific invitations to the\\r\\npeople whom you want to attend. Catering\\r\\nMany smaller sprints either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby restaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and preferably some sodas or coffee.

An example of this is the Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS). During every release cycle, the\\r\\nUbuntu community gathers together to discuss, debate, and design the next release of Ubuntu. The summit is broken into a number of tracks (community, desktop, server, mobile, quality\\r\\nassurance, etc.), each containing a number of sessions. Each session has a leader who focuses\\r\\nthe discussion on the topic, and the attendees weigh in and discuss the best choices. By the\\r\\nend of the session, the expected outcome is a broad solution that can then be documented as\\r\\na specification from which the community can work. The UDS is a large and comprehensive summit that has been running for a number of years. It attracts more than 200 attendees, involving a huge range of sessions over multiple concurrent\\r\\ntracks, and remote participation. Organizing and running the event is a large and\\r\\ncomprehensive undertaking, and it would require another book the size of The Art of\\r\\nCommunity to discuss all the details.

Accommodation\\r\\nThere are no special accommodation requirements for summits. Equipment\\r\\nSummits are generally entirely discussion-led, but you may need to supply an Internet\\r\\nconnection, data projectors, whiteboards, writing pads, and pens and pencils. Date/time\\r\\nThe length of the summit should reflect how long you can reasonably expect people to be\\r\\ntogether. Do remember that people will need to book time off work to be there, and some\\r\\nmay be away from their families and children. I recommend that a summit range from\\r\\nthree to five days. I do not recommend a summit that lasts longer than a week. Cost\\r\\nTo the best of your ability, summits should be free (free events provide a lower barrier to\\r\\nparticipation and do not exclude those who can’t afford the fee to get in). You should seek\\r\\nto cover your costs with sponsorship if your organization can’t cover the funds itself. Registering attendance\\r\\nYou will want to get a firm idea of who is coming, but also make the summit open so that\\r\\nanyone is welcome to attend. As such, it is recommended that you have an attendee list\\r\\nbut also publicize the open nature of the event. Catering\\r\\nMany smaller summits either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby restaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and preferably some sodas or coffee.

Leslie Hawthorn of Google reports:\\r\\n“I’m particularly proud of the feedback we’ve received on the Summits, our attendees repeatedly\\r\\ntelling us that the connections they make that weekend lead to collaborative development between\\r\\nprojects. It’s also an excellent opportunity for these seasoned Open Sourcerers to share best\\r\\npractices and not just around participating in Google Summer of Code; some of the most important\\r\\nknowledge-sharing that takes place at the Summits is when contributors finally get to meet face-to-\\r\\nface; exchange ideas; and form the social ties that cause patches to be reviewed and merged more\\r\\nquickly, requests for support answered rapidly, etc. The typical view of FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open\\r\\nSource Software) development is that everything takes place online, but that’s only a part of the\\r\\ninteractions that fuel Open Source; without these in-person meetings, establishing a reputation and\\r\\nsecuring the trust of one’s fellow project members certainly occurs, but much more slowly.

In its goals, an unconference appears to be the same as a normal conference: a\\r\\ngroup of people gather in a venue to watch a series of talks and discussions. There is, though,\\r\\none key difference: an unconference has its schedule created on the day of the event\\r\\nin an entirely free-form way.

You can find more details about the event at http://www\\r\\n.communityleadershipsummit.com. The history of unconferences traces back to O’Reilly’s invitation-only geek event, FooCamp\\r\\n(“Friends of O’Reilly” camp). The real success and growth of unconferences has been exhibited\\r\\nby the BarCamp spin-off events. BarCamp was originally a joke between Chris Messina and a couple of friends regarding some\\r\\nsomewhat disgruntled people who had not been invited to O’Reilly’s FooCamp. Curious as to\\r\\nwhy these people were complaining, Chris and friends decided to run an equivalent event,\\r\\ncoining it BarCamp, as a nod to the (ironic in this case) foobar references in O’Reilly books. Chris explained to me how the event came about:\\r\\nWe just thought it’d be fun to get a bunch of friends together and have an emergent (or “open\\r\\nspace”) event to offset FooCamp. The crazy thing is that we planned the whole thing in only six\\r\\ndays.

From my experience with unconferences, the free-form scheduling always uncovers unusual\\r\\nand intriguing topics. There will be topics proposed that you or a wider scheduling body would\\r\\nhave never thought of, and this can make for some really interesting and fascinating discussion. Fortunately, unconferences are devilishly simply to organize. In addition to the obvious\\r\\nresources, such as a venue and attendees, your primary consideration is a place where people\\r\\ncan add their sessions to the agenda. Most unconferences feature a large whiteboard (or two\\r\\nwhiteboards side-by-side) on which you write the conference grid. This is a box that shows\\r\\nthe rooms along the top and the times down the side. This will result in a number of session\\r\\nslots in which people can write in their sessions.

Catering\\r\\nMany unconferences either provide a buffet lunch or defer lunch to nearby restaurants. You should have plenty of water and cups available, and preferably some sodas or coffee. Some caffeinated beverages are particularly important if you have a long unconference:\\r\\npeople will rely on them to wake up in the mornings. Insurance/unions\\r\\nAs always, check into the insurance and union requirements for the venue. Getting Sponsorship\\r\\nEveryone reading this book is lucky, because community is one of the rare places in the world\\r\\nin which we can exist, build bridges, and reward victories without bowing to the filthy lucre. In our palm-lined oasis, money is rarely a consideration. Sometimes, though, it is. The vast majority of physical events cost money. Venues need to be booked, equipment needs\\r\\nto be rented or purchased, and other costs need to be covered. Unless you are charging an\\r\\nentrance fee that covers costs or another party you know is feeling particularly generous, it is\\r\\nlikely you are going to need to find sponsorship to cover these costs. Let’s now take a little time\\r\\nto talk about what is involved in finding sponsorship. Understanding Your Needs\\r\\nSponsorship is a somewhat hit-or-miss process. Although your community does good and valid\\r\\nwork, what you are essentially doing here is asking someone for some free money. It doesn’t\\r\\nmatter if the party you are asking is a large company. Large companies still need to account\\r\\n428   CHAPTER TWELVE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b4c7cbe3-a5cc-4dd9-8de7-ba4f04a7c935":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b4c7cbe3-a5cc-4dd9-8de7-ba4f04a7c935\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"wz9sX1L39nL1tQbbB5YBuwZBdkfgW4RxtB2ykYJlS4g=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YZiP/BXLp0DorcH+vSc+KNHaCNRLCnMS+V+rqAgbHMM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"901fb2da-390d-461d-a0ab-cb57728782ec\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"BsPqunvikpK17sqyWs9lX3YPbOB0S7NO0vl4FI6Zz5E=\"}},\"hash\":\"ySCpuUZPdni9wL8jKORyzoqKJGMD5IJZcHUo1943GiQ=\",\"text\":\"for the purposes of their expenditures, and particularly when the economy is facing difficult\\r\\ntimes, justification has never been more important. Fortunately, I have a surefire way to improve your chances of getting sponsored.

Pretty stunning stuff, eh? OK, back to the point. Consider yourself in the position of Chief Checkbook Holder for a large\\r\\norganization.

From which are you more likely to demand your money’s\\r\\nworth in associated advertising and favors? Which are you more likely to say no to? NOTE\\r\\nAlthough this theory can be applied in a general sense to most volunteer\\r\\ncommunity events, if you are organizing a large conference event (particularly if\\r\\nthe audience is composed of professionals), asking for more money can legitimize\\r\\nthe event. Although true, you should tread carefully with this approach: get it\\r\\nwrong and you may get nothing. If you are considering asking for a significant sum of money, I recommend you\\r\\nspeak to someone with event organization experience first and get that person’s\\r\\ntake before you click the Send button on your proposal to the sponsor. As such, you need to perform an exercise in cost cutting. You should first produce a big list of\\r\\neverything that is going to cost money, in either rental or purchase costs. This list should be\\r\\naccurate and complete. Everything from pens to the venue to expensive computing equipment\\r\\nshould be on that list. Your next step is to go through the list and turn it into a trimming exercise. The goal here is\\r\\nnot to remove things you actually need, but instead to find ways to source those things without\\r\\npaying for them.

Naturally, another\\r\\nindicator toward a potential “yes” on your sponsorship request is that the company has money. If the company is known to be struggling financially, save your energy and focus only on cash-\\r\\npositive organizations. Determining potential sponsors can be a tricky road to navigate. The best way to do this is to\\r\\nrun the idea of sponsorship by some people you know well in existing companies who are\\r\\npotential sponsors. They may be able to help you get up to the next rung in the ladder. Every\\r\\ntime I have organized an event that needed sponsorship, this has been my first port of call. Another approach is to meet someone involved in an existing event that is similar to your own\\r\\nand ask how that person handled sponsorship. Another useful technique is to look at the\\r\\nsponsorship lists for these other events. Often the primary sponsors are listed on the front page\\r\\nof the event website. Setting expectations\\r\\nWhen asking for sponsorship, it’s important to remember that you are engaging in a business\\r\\ntransaction. The organization giving you money expects something in return. Specifically what\\r\\nthey expect varies tremendously between sponsors. Some sponsors will expect almost nothing. A good example of this is a company called\\r\\nBytemark Hosting, which has sponsored every year of LugRadio Live since it began. The\\r\\ncompany has provided venue sponsorship year after year, even back when no one knew the\\r\\nevent or its expectations. Bytemark not only had faith in the event but was gracious in its\\r\\nexpectations: all it wanted was an exhibition table. On the other hand, some sponsors want the moon on a stick. Another (unnamed to protect\\r\\nthe innocent) sponsor I have dealt with wanted branding scattered across the venue, weekly\\r\\ncalls with its demanding marketing manager, regular branding mentions in the podcast that\\r\\nwe did, control over the size and location of its booth, and other requests. The experience with\\r\\nthat sponsor was, frankly, a huge headache that none of the event organizers needed, especially\\r\\nwith so much else going on.

As an\\r\\nexample, consider this trail of dependencies:\\r\\n1. To get the sponsorship money, the sponsor requires a bank account to transfer the\\r\\nmoney to. 2.

But after each event, we always conduct a survey to\\r\\ngather feedback on the event, assess how well it went, perform a stakeholder review, and make\\r\\nappropriate changes where it makes sense. How It Works\\r\\nThe UDS has a fairly simple structure for attendees. The event lasts a week, from Monday to\\r\\nFriday, and each day is broken into a series of (approximately) one-hour sessions. The venue\\r\\nhas 14 meeting rooms available, and thus 14 sessions can occur at any one time. With so many\\r\\ntypes of discussions split across so many sessions, we have a series of tracks that represent\\r\\ndifferent themes of discussion. Examples of tracks include Desktop, Server, Community, Kernel,\\r\\nand Design. Each track has a track lead who coordinates the sessions for her respective track. Throughout the venue, we have TV screens displaying the schedule and the attendees choose\\r\\nwhich session they want to attend at the beginning of each time slot. Each session covers a\\r\\nspecific topic and the attendees discuss plans for that topic. As an example, a session may be\\r\\nhow to grow the number of Ubuntu translators and the attendees will share and discuss ideas for\\r\\nhow to accomplish this goal. Then, near the end of the session, the session leader will jot down\\r\\na set of work items that the attendees agreed to. That is the basic gist of how a UDS works. Let’s now delve into the details of how the event is\\r\\nput together, along with many of the subtle decisions we have made over the years that have\\r\\nhelped the event become what it is today.

Community\\r\\nOf course, there is the wider community who have a clear set of ideas and requests for\\r\\nhow the UDS operates. While the community has no operational responsibility to deliver\\r\\non these requirements (unlike the needs of the CEO, founder etc.), I still consider the\\r\\ncommunity to be an important stakeholder as the event attracts many community\\r\\nattendees. Our community rarely has any specific requirements, but often presents many\\r\\ngreat and some not-so-great ideas.

As such, our venue requirements also include a room where we\\r\\ncan have a social function for around 500 guests. This also gets more complex when you have sponsors who want to organize their own social\\r\\nevents; typically they won’t want all social events to take place in the same room each night. As such, a venue with multiple social event locations is a great find. Of course, you could host\\r\\nsocial events off-site, but organizing buses is a pain, and buses impact the social structure of\\r\\nthe event; if the last bus leaves at 9:30 p.m. and you are having a great time, the event is cut\\r\\noff prematurely.

Location\\r\\nLocation, location, location, baby! This is what toadying real estate agents tell us all the time,\\r\\nbut exactly the same applies to choosing a great venue for your event. Location choice is a delicate balance. On the one hand, you want to pick a fun, interesting, and\\r\\ndesirable location, but on the other hand, you don’t want your attendees to spend their time\\r\\nout and about, soaking up the location, and not actually participating in your event. This choice is more complex for smaller events where you have a wider set of options available\\r\\nfor venues. If you are hosting an event for 100 people and need 3 or 4 rooms, you can pretty\\r\\nmuch hold that event anywhere; there are plenty of venues that meet your needs. For an event\\r\\nsuch as a UDS with its extensive meeting room and space requirements, our options are\\r\\nconsiderably more limited. The simple reality is that there just aren’t that many venues that can support a UDS’s\\r\\nrequirements, and as such, it makes the location list a pretty straightforward choice between\\r\\na limited set of options. While I am not actively involved in the choice of venue or location for the UDS, I have worked\\r\\nwith the team that is, and these are some of the considerations they make based on location:\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nSafety is the first and primary consideration.

You should also assess how far the venue is from the local airport/train station/\\r\\nbus link; if you are allowing people to expense their taxis to the venue, it all adds up. Social opportunities\\r\\nThe social opportunities in the area are important to consider. Some locations can offer\\r\\ntoo few (e.g., we once had a UDS in the middle of a Belgian forest with nothing to do, and\\r\\nthings started getting a little like Lord of the Flies after a few weeks), while others can offer\\r\\ntoo many (e.g., I am pretty sure there will never be a UDS in Las Vegas). From my\\r\\nexperience, most people want a few decent dinner options within walking distance, a\\r\\ncheap bar nearby where they can socialize, and if possible, a convenience store to buy\\r\\nforgotten toothbrushes and deodorant. Desirability\\r\\nPicking an interesting location can often significantly increase the chances of people\\r\\nattending the event and tacking a few days before or after the event for some vacation\\r\\ntime. I have seen this in past years when the UDS has taken place in Florida, Prague, and\\r\\nCalifornia. Local opportunities\\r\\nAnother consideration, particularly for commercial investors in the community, is to\\r\\nidentify local opportunities that can be connected to an event. A good example of this for\\r\\na technology company would be to have an event near Silicon Valley in California; you\\r\\ncould then use the event as a means to attract companies and representatives to meetings. This is something we sometimes consider for the UDS. Of course, an important consideration in all of this is cost. With the UDS we know the venue\\r\\ncosts will be significant due to the size of the event, and we also factor in the cost of the local\\r\\namenities. As an example, Las Vegas and the San Francisco Bay Area are pretty expensive\\r\\nareas, but Eastern Europe is much cheaper. Instead of looking for a clear-cut solution in each case, try to find a balance. You may find a\\r\\nvenue that is inexpensive but in an area that doesn’t offer much in terms of socializing, or you\\r\\nmight find a venue that is more expensive but is convenient in terms of travel and offers lots\\r\\nof fun things to do.

This format has a few distinct benefits:\\r\\nGood for remote participants\\r\\nOne of the most frustrating experiences for a remote participant is when he can’t hear\\r\\npeople in the room speaking because they are too far away from the microphones. The\\r\\nfishbowl approach, by definition, asks active speakers to sit closer to the front, which is\\r\\ncloser to the microphones that stream the content to remote participants. This makes it\\r\\nmuch easier to hear what is going on. Easy access to projectors\\r\\nTypically, active speakers in a session may want to use the projectors, either by referencing\\r\\ncontributions from the chat room or by plugging their laptop into the general projector to\\r\\nshow content or take notes. Sitting these active speakers closer to the front makes the\\r\\nprojectors more conveniently available. Less bending and twisting\\r\\nIf you don’t have a fishbowl layout and active speakers are scattered around the room,\\r\\nattendees may have to bend and twist their bodies to see who is speaking and to participate\\r\\nin the discussion. If these active speakers are at the front of the room they are closer to\\r\\none another and everyone else just needs to face forward. This reduces the strain and pain\\r\\nthat can build up when you are bending and twisting all day in sessions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"bfc6b844-1f9a-49eb-969c-d38531345e91":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"bfc6b844-1f9a-49eb-969c-d38531345e91\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"G7aLnujuweuM3qHgthUo++WYX3A8k7Gux8dm6NVENSM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"/SjU5c3g3/u+85XIbZn23zo/lJSHy5cPOVgDgdsFMxI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"68afe243-1c80-44ad-9c93-2819cffac6bd\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"HmcvQWwELqzCmEsl6xRX+P+Q5z2iUXeCuoKvPi7aS7o=\"}},\"hash\":\"hXMHa3btPe6fP/Oq6yDjtTTwi8yn+GsCXq0nKhaGpaY=\",\"text\":\"An important point about using the fishbowl is that you need to enforce it; if someone is\\r\\nactively participating, be sure to ask her to move to the front so that she can be part of the\\r\\nfishbowl.

There was always so much cool\\r\\nwork going on, and we felt it could be awesome to have a way to share this work with the\\r\\nwider audience. And thus plenaries were born. Each day at 2 p.m. we begin an hour of 15-minute plenary\\r\\nsessions that take place in the main auditorium where the kickoff session took place. We invite everyone to participate in the plenaries; as such, they often consist of a mix of tech\\r\\ndemos, summaries of in-process work, and sponsor presentations. Importantly, for the sponsor\\r\\npresentations we disallow marketing pitches; they have to be of genuine interest to the\\r\\naudience.

We always host the lightning talks on Friday afternoon because people are usually pretty\\r\\nburned out at that point and it is easier to keep their attention with a collection of short talks. The most important thing when running lightning talks is to stick to the time slot for each talk. You will want an energetic moderator who is not afraid to boot people off when their time is\\r\\nup. We usually have lightning talk speakers line up in a row next to the stage so that they can\\r\\nbe ushered on one by one.

Often there is no implicit connection between the\\r\\nsession and the work outlined in the session. We built a system for the UDS that helps close this gap. For each piece of work that we want to focus on in a new release we ask our community to\\r\\nfile a blueprint. A blueprint (as discussed in “Structuring Your Projects” on page 281) is a web\\r\\npage that reflects the current status of a project. The blueprint also provides a means for people\\r\\nto subscribe to it to see when the project status changes. We ask our attendees to file blueprints for all the projects they want to work on in the next\\r\\ncycle. Each blueprint can be targeted to an upcoming sprint. One of these sprint options is the\\r\\nnext UDS. When a blueprint is targeted for a sprint it is added to a queue of blueprints to be reviewed for\\r\\ninclusion in the next UDS. Blueprints we approve are automatically scheduled in a system\\r\\ncalled summit.ubuntu.com. This system is a custom-built scheduling system that reads in all\\r\\nthe blueprints and schedules them on the right track based on how they were named (e.g., a\\r\\nblueprint that starts with “community” is added to the community track). When someone subscribes to a blueprint, summit.ubuntu.com identifies that this person\\r\\nshould be in the session. People can also mark themselves as participation essential for a\\r\\nblueprint. The summit.ubuntu.com system then builds a schedule based on when everyone\\r\\ncan attend the session, prioritizing the sessions by those marked as participation essential for a\\r\\ngiven session. This approach ensures that we have a fully optimized schedule. The scheduling system also includes a feature that prevents people from camping out in rooms\\r\\nand missing out on other sessions they may want to attend. We used to manually schedule the\\r\\nUDS and assign rooms to tracks; thus people who would be interested in a track would\\r\\nsometimes set up shop in a room and not leave.

When we look back at the history of communities in which people worked together on the\\r\\nInternet, virtually all communication was handled in two environments: email or Usenet\\r\\n(groups in which you send email). Both of these media have always been slow. When you\\r\\ndiscuss a topic over email, it is entirely expected that a conversation can last days or even weeks,\\r\\nwith hours in between each message. Although email still dominates the world as a primary medium for general communication\\r\\nonline, advances in real-time discussion facilities have made it possible to hold real-time\\r\\nmeetings in which people converse with one another in the same time slot. This has raised the\\r\\nopportunity for online meetings in which multiple people can join and have a conversation. Online events are something that I have used extensively throughout my work with Ubuntu,\\r\\nbut it surprises me how little other communities have made use of them. In the Ubuntu\\r\\ncommunity, they have been hugely useful and always netted upward of 300 attending\\r\\neach event. If you have a geographically dispersed community, here are some of the types of online events\\r\\nthat could be useful to run:\\r\\nTutorial weeks\\r\\nThese are special weeks in which a series of teaching and best-practice sessions are run to\\r\\neducate your community in how to do things. This has been used extensively in the\\r\\nUbuntu community. Release parties\\r\\nMany communities have online release parties to celebrate the release of a new piece of\\r\\nsoftware, initiative, or some other project. Instead of meeting in a bar or restaurant, these\\r\\nparties happen online in a chat room, and people sit at their computers and have a few\\r\\ndrinks while having a good time with one another.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"69bff76f-4079-40fa-89e7-cd6a7a30de44":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"69bff76f-4079-40fa-89e7-cd6a7a30de44\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"eFwbKXdNhFy0mvnm/hdjPm3QznLrhw4eAYTgRs2rDtg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"WkJE0EbV9onlFuLyguwAfpIrh90l9F/QNA3NUhJ/LkE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d59e2e2d-0e14-47b9-b4f6-61657c9832f5\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Soa7/ze54MAQBJ3AH6C4u5M0dvrrmTPmMi3kLlUdFLE=\"}},\"hash\":\"2as76J7pE/wS1Ven6AJqSyDMDH/DgjkpuucM749J0RQ=\",\"text\":\"CREATING AND RUNNING EVENTS   453\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d8333a97-0081-4ac9-85bc-323cb10686b5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d8333a97-0081-4ac9-85bc-323cb10686b5\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"GFLy8cAty3Mb+hAONF3H4mqN/UDJ5g5hLyCzlL+3dHA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"58dF31afLflZjkST2qx8/Li2Qa4SbyQnyBtoemQdQyM=\"}},\"hash\":\"A8kxuy1TirzfUKaIdU3WyV+A+adSu8S2PVF+7jW3bWM=\",\"text\":\"Focused activity days\\r\\nThese days are intended to bring the community together around a specific initiative. In\\r\\nthe Ubuntu community, these events come in the form of Bug Days (designed to focus\\r\\npeople on fixing bugs) and Docs Days (designed to focus people on improving the\\r\\ncommunity documentation). I have not included team meetings in this, as they are less special events and more an expected\\r\\ncomponent in teams and governance bodies. Online events related to governance and conflict\\r\\nresolution were discussed earlier in the chapters devoted to those topics. Common Attributes\\r\\nEarlier, when we explored some of the organizational characteristics behind physical events,\\r\\nwe discussed some common elements that apply to all events. This included accommodation,\\r\\ndate/time, equipment, and so on. We are now going to do the same for online events. The\\r\\nfollowing are the common considerations that apply to all online events. Medium\\r\\nThe first and most important consideration is what medium you want to use to host the event. Each medium that you use will need to be in real time: it is the instant gratification of real-\\r\\ntime communication that makes events feel like events. These are some of the attributes that you should look for in a medium:\\r\\nAppropriateness\\r\\nWill the medium meet your needs? As an example, if you are running a training course\\r\\nfor a few hundred people, a voice teleconference is inappropriate because only one person\\r\\ncan talk at a time. However, you might deliver a talk and answer questions over a voice\\r\\nconnection while accepting questions and allowing chat on a text medium. Accessibility\\r\\nYou should ensure that all of your members can access the medium you choose. This\\r\\ndepends a lot on your community. With this consideration, you need to determine not\\r\\nonly whether your community has the technical facilities (e.g., computing power and\\r\\nInternet bandwidth) but also whether members are familiar with or able to learn how to\\r\\naccess the medium. Values\\r\\nYou should ensure that the chosen medium meets the values of your community. As an\\r\\nexample, if you are part of an open source community that values software freedom, you\\r\\nshould not choose a medium that is closed source. Whatever your choice of medium, you should ensure that access to it is well documented and\\r\\nthat your community is fully aware of where to find the documentation and how to connect. 454   CHAPTER TWELVE\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ab172621-bd2a-490d-a535-5c7c680fde93":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ab172621-bd2a-490d-a535-5c7c680fde93\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"D2ZjI70WCRFvjEIp0dy/ZOsNlJhiuvrFjRPKlPkiC2Y=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"PyD/v5j43es9yBIw8py2dwIfn1g6HGBaSR+OVSCF5hY=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"47003924-6e3c-4f05-af17-040bea771eaa\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"YfJXeAYtdCywx6j85iM9UcNlg/rViNZoUvA1Esq8SsY=\"}},\"hash\":\"6axWRz/LVO2td+vo647W9uzxAzO9chTEP5/Z3sJFH/4=\",\"text\":\"Examples include:\\r\\n•Freenode\\r\\n•EFNet\\r\\nInternet Relay Chat is a simple and efficient medium that is popular in the technical\\r\\ncommunity. IRC is also open and transparent, and there are free clients for all operating\\r\\nsystems. Another benefit of IRC is that it can host literally hundreds of participants at the same\\r\\ntime, yet is low-bandwidth: it does not require a fast Internet connection. This is important if\\r\\nyour community members may be using dial-up Internet access. IRC has two downsides. First, it is text-only, and some may not find it quite so engaging. Second, it is largely unknown in nontechnical communities. As such, if you decide on IRC for\\r\\na nontechnical event, you will have to tutor your community on how to use it. I have found IRC to be an excellent medium for organizing events. I have used it for many\\r\\nUbuntu-related events, such as the Ubuntu Open Week, Ubuntu Developer Week, LoCo\\r\\nDocumentation Days, release parties, and more. While IRC is useful, I have always been\\r\\nconscious to remember that most members start out unfamiliar with IRC and how to use it. You should always ensure that there are nice, clear instructions (with screenshots) showing\\r\\nhow to connect with IRC. Examples include:\\r\\n•Skype\\r\\n•Ekiga\\r\\nOnline telephony such as Skype or a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client such as Ekiga is\\r\\nthe equivalent of having a conference call. As such, the same benefits and limitations apply:\\r\\nyou can’t practically have more than 5–10 people in a conversation, but it does feel engaging. A downside of this medium is that it requires (a) a reasonably powerful Internet connection\\r\\nand (b) sound hardware and a microphone, which may not be as common as you would expect. I have found VoIP to be useful for meetings, but not for general-purpose events due to the\\r\\nscaling issues. Another blocker for VoIP is that while Skype works great for many people, other\\r\\nclients require a significant amount of fiddling with firewalls and other networking mumbo\\r\\njumbo to get them working. When you organize an event, the last thing you want is your\\r\\nattendees fighting with the tools they need to connect.

A particularly interesting feature with the voice chat in Second Life is spatial sound, in which\\r\\nthe location of the sound in the stereo field changes based on where the person is. As an\\r\\nexample, if you sit between two people in a discussion, the person on the left will come out of\\r\\nthe left speaker more.

Date/time\\r\\nWhen choosing an event date and time, be conscious that you are potentially open to a\\r\\nworldwide audience. As such, you are faced with the complex task of picking a time that will\\r\\nsuit most of your likely attendees. Here you need to take a reasonable survey of where most of your attendees live in the world\\r\\nand what times are going to be suitable for the majority. You are never going to make everyone\\r\\nhappy all the time, and some people will complain because they won’t be able to attend. A common approach I have used is to pick a time that is in the afternoon in Europe. As an\\r\\nexample, with Ubuntu Open Week (a week of tutorial sessions), I ensure that each day there\\r\\nare only four or five hours of available sessions but that they are spread throughout the week\\r\\nduring European afternoon hours. This ensures that the West Coast of the United States can\\r\\nget online early in the morning, while on the East Coast of the US it is midday, and in Asia\\r\\nand beyond it is later at night. This approach has helped our events to hit the most people\\r\\nwithin the worldwide spread of contributors that are involved in the Ubuntu community.

When the\\r\\ncommunication channels are open and conversation flows freely, your community gains\\r\\nmomentum, progress is made, and your members will feel engaged. Internal communication should seek to satisfy a range of needs that are involved in running\\r\\na successful community.

Meetings are a key component in ensuring that your community is running effectively. They\\r\\nprovide a number of opportunities:\\r\\nDiscuss progress\\r\\nWith your strategic plan and road map in place, you can use meetings as an opportunity\\r\\nto communicate progress on OBJECTIVES, GOALS, and ACTIONS. Discuss solutions\\r\\nMeetings are a chance to discuss the implementation of solutions and any problems that\\r\\nyour community may have. Assign tasks\\r\\nMeetings are useful for identifying what needs to be done and getting people to volunteer\\r\\nto work on specific tasks. Resolve conflict\\r\\nEvery community has conflict, and yours will be no different. Meetings are a useful place\\r\\nto air issues and resolve personal conflict. We discussed conflict resolution in detail in\\r\\nChapter 11. Within every community, a primary medium for regular communication should exist. Every\\r\\ncommunity member should know they can come together with other members at an agreed\\r\\nplace and at a regular interval to discuss and debate the issues that are before the community. This is the function of a regular meeting. The first step in getting regular meetings up and running is to choose a location. There are\\r\\nvarious options available, such as IRC, conference calls, and more. I recommend IRC, though,\\r\\nCREATING AND RUNNING EVENTS   457\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"67d0f9e4-ecb3-44cf-a48f-9777e99c881b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"67d0f9e4-ecb3-44cf-a48f-9777e99c881b\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"R2WFY4yVgxB99l6cRVUtdxg2jEwOxULI3gqXIFGE2jA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"CZd0PnfeGL//pqbqm9tcrqBKM/tIAxAj/wRdKG5/qlU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d6653981-46eb-4257-a18b-c36a6dc6dc41\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Ys6jpoUFBP5NjgftXs79B99WFZOyXVxbVRBHmKMw0BM=\"}},\"hash\":\"Z9l1IOy+tM3u+uZSWN8EYtLqa3V2K6b3/VSIH2RYjdk=\",\"text\":\"as these meetings will be open and relatively easy to access, and the conversations can be\\r\\nlogged.

Whatever you\\r\\ndecide, choose that regularity and stick to it. Ensure that your regularity is bound to a day. As\\r\\nan example, your meeting could be “the first Monday of the month. ” Regularity is largely\\r\\ndependent on your community and how much discussion needs to occur. I recommend a\\r\\nminimum of one meeting a month and to increase the regularity if required. Choosing a time is a complex task for international online communities. You should look at\\r\\nyour primary set of contributors and where they are based, and ensure that you have your\\r\\ncore contributors at meetings. Try to pick times that average out as suitable for the majority of\\r\\ncontributors. This may involve some early mornings or late nights for some people to attend. If you have a truly global spread of contributors, you may also want to alternate meeting times\\r\\nso that the early mornings and late nights don’t bite the same contributors every time.

Focus on outcomes\\r\\nAlways do your best to keep the discussion focused on finding outcomes and actions for\\r\\nmoving forward.

Its\\r\\npresence is felt more and more at conferences, in papers, on blogs, and across the current global\\r\\nsensation that is Twitter. Regardless of the medium, this explosion of interest in community\\r\\nhas happened for three closely interlinked reasons. Community is implicitly a positive word. It speaks of openness, participation, awareness, and an\\r\\nagreeable intention to engage in an environment driven by merit as well as caring for others. For open source companies, this is powerful inferred meaning that speaks well to their\\r\\naudience. As such, it makes entire sense for a company to light up its website like a Christmas\\r\\ntree with references to “community. ”\\r\\nSecond, for those interested in open source, community has become synonymous with\\r\\n“engagement in the open source space. ” Open source companies are fully aware that if they\\r\\ndon’t have an answer for their community relations strategy, they simply won’t be taken\\r\\nseriously by a significant demographic of people. Whereas five years ago this demographic of\\r\\npeople was often seen as strange, hygienically challenged, bespectacled nerds who lived in their\\r\\nmothers’ basements, it is now well known that those with buying capacity and/or influence\\r\\nare placing importance in the community attributes of open source. These are real customers\\r\\nwho have developed this value expectation due to the constantly reinforced open source\\r\\nmantra of participation, community, and technical quality. When the industry cradles open\\r\\nsource and its associated values, the big cats in the ecosystem need to adjust to reflect that. Finally, irksome economic times have resulted in very real consequences for small businesses. Executives have been forced to reassess how they can achieve their goals and ambitions with\\r\\na more painful awareness of the bottom line. Multiple marketing and engineering people can\\r\\nbe expensive—a lot more expensive than a community manager. The accumulation of reasons for building community in a business environment has created\\r\\na strong commercial justification for community and for those who can build it, along with a\\r\\nset of expectations around what these community builders can deliver.

When the high-level\\r\\nrepresentation of community managers overplays the very real “on the ground” focus of the role,\\r\\nthe balance becomes unset and there is a risk of genericizing community management as “the theory\\r\\nof working with groups of similar interests” as opposed to connecting the term firmly with hands-\\r\\non best practice in building real communities that do real, measurable work. As you are looking to fill your community manager role, be aware of this hype and how it affects\\r\\ncandidates. To avoid it, look for substance in the day-to-day interactions, achievements, and efforts\\r\\nin the candidate’s work. If there is an overwhelming level of theory and social science in response\\r\\nto direct questions about this day-to-day work, alarm bells should trigger. The Role of a Community Manager in the Corporation\\r\\nIn recent years the Internet has been ablaze with chatter over where community management\\r\\nshould fit into an organization.

Setting Expectations\\r\\nBefore you put pen to paper on a job description for your new community manager, it is\\r\\nimportant to get some expectations straight around the role. Community management is\\r\\nfundamentally complicated, and many organizations with mismanaged expectations have\\r\\nmade some very costly mistakes in finding someone to effectively build their community. Unlike positions with a longer history in companies, where roles and expectations are clear,\\r\\ncommunity management embodies a lot of ambiguity and can confound hiring managers. Scope of the Role\\r\\nBusy hiring managers who already have many other roles to fill often fail to recognize the\\r\\nimportance of understanding a community, so their job description contains unreasonable\\r\\nexpectations around the role. A mismatched job description means that when a candidate is\\r\\nfound, he resultantly has something of a bumpy road in getting a grip on the role. If you are\\r\\nlucky and get a hardy candidate who is willing to take the knocks while the role is being fleshed\\r\\nout, you may come out all right in the end, but the adjustment is stressful for most candidates\\r\\nand wasteful for the company. To understand the scope of the role, you need to first understand (a) what the scope of the\\r\\ncommunity is and (b) what your expectations are for someone to work with that community\\r\\nto enable and extend it. Let’s break these two separate points into a series of questions that\\r\\nyou should answer before you craft the job description, beginning with the scope of the\\r\\ncommunity itself:\\r\\n•   Who is in your community? •   How big is it? •   What kinds of skills and diversity are present in your community? •   How does the community interact and work with your company?

When you have answers to all of these questions, you should have a set of broad, high-level\\r\\ngoals and ambitions that you would like to see your community manager focus on. You should\\r\\nnow run these goals and ambitions past some other members of your organization to ensure\\r\\nthat they are doable for a community manager candidate. As you receive feedback, you can\\r\\nrefine this set of goals and expectations. When you have hired your manager, you can use this set of goals and expectations to build a\\r\\nfull strategy for the manager. We will discuss this a little later in this chapter. Risk\\r\\nOne element you should be entirely clear about is the risk associated with bringing a\\r\\ncommunity manager on board. Fundamentally, what you are doing is hiring someone who\\r\\nwill become a public face and representative of not only the community, but also the company. If you get the right person with a strong commitment to both, you have the potential for a long\\r\\nand productive relationship. If you get the wrong person, your difficulties may be\\r\\nembarrassingly exposed to the world. The primary risk here is that when someone represents your community, she acts as a delicate\\r\\nmiddleperson between the organization and the community. This person plays a careful role\\r\\nin balancing expectations and making it clear that she will represent the best interests of each\\r\\nto the other. With this responsibility lies the risk of the community manager getting frustrated with both\\r\\nthe organization and the community.

We discussed the topic of burnout earlier in\\r\\nChapter 11. In summary, you need to be extremely careful about whom you hire into your community\\r\\nmanagement role. You and your community manager are going to need to be able to\\r\\nunderstand these risks and be able to handle them in a professional and upstanding way. You\\r\\nneed to find someone whom you implicitly trust and who is not going to put a personal agenda\\r\\nbefore the community. Breaking Tradition\\r\\nAnother expectation to adopt is that community managers may well need to step outside the\\r\\ntraditional boundaries of the business world. For a community manager to really build a\\r\\nrapport with the community, he needs to fundamentally be a member of that community and\\r\\nexhibit the culture of that community. That in itself can ruffle some feathers in the\\r\\norganization. Much of this is based around seemingly unimportant elements that actually play a key role in\\r\\ncommunity management. As an example, most volunteer communities are very casual places. People wear casual clothes, and you should expect your community manager to do this as well. You should expect your community manager to be vocal, loud, and opinionated. It is this over-\\r\\nthe-top personality that will pump up the community and get them excited. You should expect\\r\\nstimulating and vivacious presentations at conferences, laptops covered in stickers, amusing\\r\\nand conversational interviews, and other elements. While I am not suggesting that you should\\r\\ndemand these attributes from your community manager, don’t be surprised if you get them. In my own experience, I have brought a huge amount of my personality to my work. My\\r\\ncommunities know of my wacky sense of humor, my love of heavy metal, my loud and gag-\\r\\nladen presentations, and my up-front and frank discussions with community members. I am\\r\\nproud of this approach to my work, and other communities are likely to be the same. You\\r\\nshould ensure that your hires are free enough to exercise individuality in this role. Despite this, of course, there is a line. When you have the opportunity for vivacious and\\r\\nexcitable representation in the role, there is an increased possibility of your community\\r\\nmanager putting a foot down wrong, offending someone, stepping out of line, or otherwise\\r\\nembarrassing herself, the community, and the company.

Earlier we talked about whether the role fulfills more of a marketing or\\r\\nengineering approach, and you should consider this carefully. To make this decision, look back at the questions we discussed when talking about the scope\\r\\nof the role earlier in this chapter, and determine whether your community manager is going\\r\\nto be focusing more on your message about the community or the collaborative infrastructure,\\r\\nprocesses, and growth of the community. In other words, are you expecting your community\\r\\nmanager to help talk about the community and company at conferences and to customers and\\r\\njournalists, or to actually help grow, build, refine, and optimize the nuts and bolts in the\\r\\ncontributor community? It is likely that the answer to this question will be “both,” but consider which is the prevalent\\r\\nfocus. As an example, if your community manager is primarily looking after a contributor\\r\\ncommunity that produces an open source product, I heavily recommend that she reports to\\r\\nan engineering manager. If, however, you primarily expect the community manager to fly\\r\\naround the world to talk about and represent the community at conferences and tradeshows\\r\\nand to speak to the press, I recommend two things. First, have her report to your marketing\\r\\ndepartment, and second, change her title from community manager to something else: she is\\r\\nrepresenting the community, not managing it, and many people will expect the latter and be\\r\\ndisappointed. The ability to enact change\\r\\nHot on the heels of which part of the organization the community manager reports to is how\\r\\nmuch control and opportunity this person has to enact change. This is a complex but\\r\\nunfortunately common problem with many who have hired community managers: they\\r\\nsucceed in bringing information about the community into the company, but lack the power\\r\\nand contacts to implement any of the change they recommend. As an example, imagine your community manager recommends a series of improvements to\\r\\nan element of your community’s technical workflow. These improvements may require\\r\\ntechnical changes or refinements in other parts of the organization, such as a specific\\r\\nengineering resource.

Form an\\r\\nagreement to work together on combined problems and get approval from the manager to\\r\\nregularly discuss the prioritization of these problems. The Responsibilities of Community Engagement\\r\\nAnother important attribute to consider is how your organization expects to interact with the\\r\\ncommunity after a community manager comes on board. In many, many organizations, once\\r\\nthey proudly hire someone into an explicit community management role, other people in\\r\\nthe organization assume that the community manager will carry out interaction with the\\r\\ncommunity on behalf of the teams. As an example, if a software company has a department\\r\\nthat builds a particular product, it may be assumed that any and all community growth and\\r\\ninteraction with regard to that product will be performed by the community manager. You need to determine whether your community manager will indeed perform this function\\r\\nin the organization or whether he will instead act as more of a consultant to help other people\\r\\nin the company work directly with the community. Whatever the decision, it needs to be\\r\\nclearly communicated across the organization and the community. My recommendation is that your community manager should perform direct interaction with\\r\\nthe community for some teams but act as a consultant for most community-facing teams. This\\r\\nway you will have a high quality of interaction in key places where it matters most, and can\\r\\nbuild a culture of community interaction in your organization.

These expectations are the meat and potatoes of what will constitute the role. There are some other, subtler expectations that may be involved in the role, though, and you\\r\\nshould make these clear also.

You\\r\\nshould augment these words with the general best practices used when new employees enter\\r\\nyour organization. NOTE\\r\\nAs we work through each area, I will present the information from the perspective\\r\\nof the manager of a community manager. As such, much of this information will\\r\\nbe of primary use either to readers who need to hire and manage a community\\r\\nmanager or to community managers who are hiring a team. As I mentioned at the\\r\\nbeginning of this chapter, though, if you are a current or prospective community\\r\\nmanager, this content can help illustrate some of the expectations that your\\r\\nmanager will have of you. Induction\\r\\nWhen your community manager first joins your organization, you will have to cover the usual\\r\\nset of induction-related items: setting up email addresses, accessing company resources,\\r\\ncreating calendars, and other such activities. Although these are important, they are not of\\r\\ninterest to us here. More important is the way your community manager exploits the induction\\r\\nperiod to define his reputation in the organization and the community. 476   CHAPTER THIRTEEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"55ede1ee-33cb-418b-8218-1004bc43ac06":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"55ede1ee-33cb-418b-8218-1004bc43ac06\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"cC46Om3bxUmJsTXiVyt6OcL2eJHhhdkKYAGijC20Ftg=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"VvNPeTPkIcTNPW93HkpSfasnKl6czb3nfk5C1YKZuHU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e9013bfa-6128-4690-92cd-774488d82786\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"68pRsiXY0xpoV1ZRYMK3XH7fCPhGIdPD9ES7PCaprUo=\"}},\"hash\":\"uPsFoUvJBqCYNK/Yc+HvktVvawS2Z9ibyLWdfJZ63G8=\",\"text\":\"Internal reputation\\r\\nReputation is critical for all community management. From the perspective of the company,\\r\\na community manager is seen as an important entity who has knowledge, focus, and awareness\\r\\nof not only how the community members think but also how they work. Remember: many\\r\\npeople simply don’t understand how community works, and the community manager acts as\\r\\na translation layer to help other parts of the organization understand how this seemingly\\r\\nrandom entity functions. With this in mind, you should carefully consider how your community manager builds his\\r\\nreputation in the organization. This is important for a few reasons. Your community manager\\r\\nis going to need to know how to work with and interact with different parts of the organization,\\r\\nand vice versa. He will be faced with many different challenges and queries within the\\r\\ncommunity, and many of these topics will need to be forwarded and integrated into other parts\\r\\nof the organization. Another important reason to build these bridges is to help your organization understand what\\r\\na community manager does. With the role still very new and unknown in the minds of many,\\r\\nsome people will either not know what the purpose of the role is or misconstrue or simply hold\\r\\na cynical idea of it (“Oh, community management—that’s just hanging out with nerds and\\r\\nwriting blog entries” is one verdict I once heard!). It is important to clarify to everyone what the role involves and build a solid reputation for\\r\\nyour community manager.

Community reputation\\r\\nYour community manager’s reputation is critical with the community she is hired to work\\r\\nwith. One of the very first tasks she should focus her efforts on is building a strong reputation\\r\\nwith the community. It is possible that this reputation already exists if you hired her out of an existing community. If not, you should ensure that she has the time and encouragement to get out there and get to\\r\\nknow the community. This can involve a range of approaches:\\r\\nParticipation in communication channels\\r\\nThe community manager should participate in communication channels such as mailing\\r\\nlists, forums, and other resources.

Travel is also an excellent\\r\\nopportunity to network and get to know important members of the community well. To help your community manager build her reputation, I recommend you ask her to read other\\r\\nparts of the book, most specifically Chapter 7. BE WARY OF TOO MUCH TRAVEL\\r\\nI have an important tip when it comes to travel, based on a mistake made with many new community\\r\\nmanagers. The recipe is often the same when a new community manager starts. He joins, there is a little bit of\\r\\npress and hype, and then the organization sends him around to every conceivable conference in\\r\\nthe interest of building his reputation. Although this is excellent for building relations with the community and beyond, it is very costly,\\r\\nboth in terms of time and money. Aside from the obvious monetary costs and the effect on personal\\r\\nlife, conference travel is going to seriously disrupt your community manager’s ability keep up with\\r\\nemail, have calls, and hold meetings. Regular and consistent participation in these more mundane\\r\\nactivities is critical to getting the basic work of the community done. So don’t make your community manager travel too much. His primary value is on the ground working\\r\\nwith your community: don’t compromise that in the interest of presenting at conferences. Strategy\\r\\nFrom the very start of your community manager’s term of service with your organization, you\\r\\nshould have a strong focus and strategic priorities. A strategic document that outlines your\\r\\ncommunity manager’s responsibilities, split into objectives, goals, and success criteria as we did\\r\\nin Chapter 2, will communicate what your community manager should be working on and\\r\\nformalize your expectations. A strategic plan is valuable to guide all your employees, of course, but it’s particularly important\\r\\nfor your community managers because there is simply so much scope in their work. A\\r\\ncommunity is a huge, boiling pot of activity that can produce a potentially epic collection of\\r\\ninformation on which a community manager can focus.

We can\\r\\nhighlight two primary areas of focus:\\r\\nWeekly engagements\\r\\nEach week, your community manager should work with different parts of your\\r\\norganization to determine what goals to work on and to quickly identify anything that\\r\\nstands in the way of those goals. Community feedback\\r\\nYour community manager is an excellent funnel through which the community can\\r\\nchannel feedback and opinion to the organization. You want to ensure that this is factored\\r\\ninto your community manager’s workflow. Let’s now take a look at both of these topics in more detail. Weekly engagements\\r\\nAs soon as your community manager joins your organization, you should set up regular calls\\r\\nor meetings in which you cover the following:\\r\\nAreas of focus\\r\\nDiscuss the current topic and areas where the community manager should focus her\\r\\nattention.

In many cases, relatively simple issues\\r\\nwill be blocking work and initiatives, and you might be able to help solve this. Community problems and concerns\\r\\nYou should also check in to see whether there are any problems with initiatives and work\\r\\nin the community itself. Are members of the community blocking this work? Are there\\r\\nconcerns and problems in the community for which you can offer help to your community\\r\\nmanager? In addition to your personal meetings, determine what other parts of the organization should\\r\\ncommunicate with the community manager on a weekly basis.

Community feedback\\r\\nWhen your community manager joins you, do your best to ensure that she is able to get\\r\\nfeedback from the community to key members of your organization. Community managers\\r\\nare always seen as primary contact points in communities, and you should expect them to\\r\\nreceive input, opinion, concerns, worries, and other useful feedback from the community. You\\r\\nwant to ensure that this feedback gets delivered to the right ears. The easiest method of doing this is to make sure your community manager knows where\\r\\nfeedback should go. When a new community manager joins an organization (particularly a\\r\\nlarge one with a complex hierarchy), this can be a complicated topic. It could be useful to\\r\\ndirectly provide her with a list of contacts to get in touch with when different topics of feedback\\r\\ncome up.

He has been the chief architect of the kernel for many years and today acts as the\\r\\nproject’s primary coordinator. In the year 2000, Linus was voted 17th in the TIME 100, TIME\\r\\nmagazine's list of the top 100 most important people of the century; in 2004, TIME named him\\r\\nas one of the most influential people in the world, and in 2006, the magazine named him as\\r\\none of the revolutionary heroes of the past 60 years. Here we discuss how Linux started, and how Linus grew his community, defined a clear set of\\r\\nvalues, and structured his community to be successful, all wrapped inside his trademark\\r\\nhonesty and frankness. When Linux started, how did you get people interested in participating? Very early on, I wasn’t even interested in people really participating; I wanted comments and\\r\\nsuggestions for features people needed. It was my project, for my own use, and what I was\\r\\ninterested in was not really so much help, as keeping my project alive by having others give\\r\\nideas and keep me motivated. When people started sending patches, I initially often ended up rewriting them to suit me better. So I really didn’t plan any of it, or work at trying to get people to participate.

How have you balanced the interest of these\\r\\ncompanies with the values your community holds important? I actually think the commercial interests have been very important to make sure that they\\r\\nbalance the purely geek interests. In other words, I think a lot of technical projects tend to easily bog down in technical issues, and\\r\\nonly have technical users, and never become very good. And I think a lot of the reasons why\\r\\nLinux got successful was because we ended up also getting all these commercial interests (fairly\\r\\nsmall in the beginning, but it was a small project, so... ) that actually counteracted some of the\\r\\n“by geeks, for geeks, nontechnical people need not apply” mentality that can otherwise often\\r\\nhappen. So the whole “technical versus business interests” thing I think has worked really, really well,\\r\\nand both bring a lot to the table. A company that lets pure business interests say what should be\\r\\ndone will result in a bad product, but it’s equally true that having pure technical issues at heart\\r\\nis also a bad approach. And no, it’s not that we actively tried to somehow “counteract” the business interests.

What kind of community did you set out to grow? The other person Creative Commons hired in April 2003 was our first international coordinator,\\r\\nbased in Berlin. One community that we set out to grow, initially via this position, was a network\\r\\nof legal scholars around the world, who could collectively figure out how Creative Commons\\r\\nlicenses work with copyright law in various jurisdictions around the world. This is the main\\r\\ncommunity that Creative Commons was and is intentional about growing. We also set out to\\r\\ngrow connections with related communities—for example, open access, open education, open\\r\\nsource—and mostly deliberately stayed away from trying to create Creative Commons\\r\\nsubcommunities within these movements, and instead play a supporting role. There always has been a mostly latent “Creative Commons community” of people who aren’t\\r\\ntied to a Creative Commons affiliate institution, and may or may not be involved with other\\r\\nnearby movements, but for whatever reason see Creative Commons as one of their primary\\r\\npassions—which is fantastic, of course.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"547d36c6-49f4-47d0-bc88-66837a3dbf62":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"547d36c6-49f4-47d0-bc88-66837a3dbf62\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"CnJoMA4VEDReMOiUYy4ZSNrps4Q2N+5H54wRkU6przI=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"oN+W1wbwpLZIrxCPr+HHRlcAds0BxT8jlP03LzlPegk=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"d71c1ccc-cfb0-47cb-9122-1a90345ebe39\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Z0f/VxCUG3dSxMoJ9SaeORjxMWstHcgCBiEuGtB4tRE=\"}},\"hash\":\"A+ftz+7yL926vHNQmRIWQjoo7ugyPwRyVQ5/8t1MeME=\",\"text\":\"Creative Commons the organization hasn’t ever really\\r\\nset out to “organize” this largely latent community, mostly due to lack of bandwidth (admittedly\\r\\nthis could seem shortsighted), and it isn’t clear how this community ought to be cultivated—it\\r\\nis a very diverse set of people.

How much growth have you seen in this work? In the past eight years Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions via\\r\\nthis process and community. In a sense this is just another instance of work occurring in chunks\\r\\namenable to work being done by lots of different people, but I think the subject matter and large\\r\\nsize and duration of the chunks makes it fairly interesting. Although many of the affiliate projects\\r\\nhave formed their own local communities that have given feedback on license drafts, the overall\\r\\nprocess is highly controlled by experts, and openness to attracting and up-leveling drive-by\\r\\ncontributors [is] not much of a factor. This arrangement has been shown to not be competitive\\r\\nfor building an encyclopedia, nor for most software and cultural projects, but perhaps should be\\r\\nevaluated if one thinks their project requires long-term commitment from a community with\\r\\nnarrow and rare expertise. Among the community involved in license porting, there has always been a desire to also do\\r\\nadvocacy and outreach, and sometimes art projects and software development.

How did you get started, and what attracted you? My “social media story” begins long before Facebook or Twitter. When I organized my first\\r\\nconference, the Perl Conference, in 1997, it was because I recognized that there was a\\r\\ncommunity online that would benefit from connecting in person. To this day, my best ever social\\r\\nmedia experience was the rush of being in the same place as people, who in many cases, had\\r\\nworked together online for years, but had never met in person, didn’t even know what each\\r\\nother looked like, had never heard the sound of each other’s voices. It’s important to remember\\r\\nhow primitive the Internet was, and how much of what we take for granted today didn’t exist\\r\\nyet. There was wonderful community, but it was a community of code and comments, of IRC\\r\\nand mailing lists. When I organized the Freeware Summit (later known as the Open Source Summit) in 1998, it\\r\\nwas because I recognized that there were multiple communities like that, that their leaders had\\r\\nnever met in person, and would benefit from talking about common problems and shaping a\\r\\ncommon story. And being a media company, we organized a press conference at the end of the\\r\\nday to get that story out. And sure enough, two months later, Linus Torvalds was on the cover\\r\\nof Forbes, with full-page pictures inside of Larry Wall, Richard Stallman, Brian Behlendorf, and\\r\\nothers. Social media is about community, about the stories that tie those communities together, and\\r\\nabout tools to amplify the connections between them. I was doing that long before I got on\\r\\nTwitter or Facebook. Which social media networks really captured your interest first? It was Twitter that first pulled me in. I had signed up for Twitter and Facebook to try them out,\\r\\nbut didn’t stick around. But one day I checked back into Twitter, and by gum, I had 5,000\\r\\nfollowers! I was embarrassed that I hadn’t been giving them anything to follow, so I started to\\r\\ntweet actively.

Many new technologies have surfaced over the years, but why do you think social media in particular has\\r\\nbeen so successful? The two greatest social media success stories to date, Facebook and Twitter, succeeded for very\\r\\ndifferent reasons, in my opinion. Facebook found a natural market where people are trying to\\r\\nget to know other new people in a compressed time frame, and built an app that “just worked”\\r\\nfor that target audience. Once it thoroughly dominated that niche, it spread from there. Twitter’s secret sauce was its minimal nature. And asymmetric following was its really great\\r\\nviral hook. But in the end, social is everywhere. Wikipedia is social, for instance. In his wonderful new book,\\r\\nReinventing Discovery, Michael Nielsen says something like “Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia. It\\r\\nis an online city whose principal export to the net is an online encyclopedia. ” And of course,\\r\\nthis is true of open source development communities as well.

SCALE, the Southern California Linux Expo, has its roots in the Los Angeles area Linux User\\r\\nGroup community. Prior to starting SCALE, many of us were involved of a series of events\\r\\nknown as “LUGFests” hosted by the Simi-Conejo Linux User Group in 2001 and 2002.

Unfortunately, after four LUGFests, the dot-com bubble burst resulted in us losing the venue\\r\\nNortel had previously been providing. Without a home and wanting to continue organizing an\\r\\nopen source event in Southern California, we teamed up with a group of students at two local\\r\\nuniversities, UCLA and USC, to start SCALE. When starting SCALE we came to a few realizations. The first was that unfortunately there were\\r\\nno companies in Southern California willing to donate space. This meant we would need to find\\r\\nways to raise money and rent space. To finance the event we began allowing companies to rent\\r\\nexhibitor space for their products, alongside the open source projects and user groups who were\\r\\nexhibiting. We also realized that we wanted a more varied group of attendees. While the LUGFests primarily\\r\\nfocused on individual users and community members, we felt this new event was also a great\\r\\nopportunity to reach a wider audience. We wanted to help grow the open source community\\r\\nand provide educational programs for both existing and new users, while also giving us, the\\r\\norganizers, a chance to meet developers and community leaders that rarely came to Southern\\r\\nCalifornia Linux User Group meetings. After the buildup, how did you start the first event? We proudly launched our first event in November 2002, cosponsored by USC, with the slogan\\r\\n“We are bringing businesses, academic institutions and the Linux community together in a way\\r\\nthat no other conference does! ” At the end of the first event we knew we had filled a need for\\r\\nthe local community. Attendees, speakers, and exhibitors alike were asking when and where\\r\\nwe would reprise the event. The first SCALE in November 2002 drew in 400 attendees, 6 presentation sessions, and an exhibit\\r\\nhall made up of 30 tabletop displays. We could not have had more than 10 volunteer team\\r\\nmembers planning the event, while today it takes a team of well over 40 volunteers to pull off\\r\\nthe conference. By our second event, we had nearly doubled in size, so we added a 2X to our name as a play on\\r\\nwords. We had “SCALE”d to twice our original size.

This allows us to include more niche project- or\\r\\ncommunity-specific content at SCALE, which might not be a good fit for the wider event. In addition to all of the content we added, we have also lost some. For example, while local user\\r\\ngroups used to make up a large portion of our exhibit hall, we now have very few that put\\r\\ntogether a presence at the event. When we first started each user group would pick a topic they\\r\\nwanted to demonstrate and staff a demo table with their members.

The biggest mistake we made at the first SCALE was not being 100% transparent with the venue\\r\\nabout our plans. As a result, we found ourselves in situations where we were overloading circuits\\r\\nwith the power draw from our expo floor, or bargaining for bandwidth at the last minute.

Speaking of venues, what do you look for in the perfect venue to host SCALE? This has changed over the years, but at the moment the two most critical factors for us are\\r\\nlocation and physical space available. The SCALE team likes to stay with a given venue as long\\r\\nas we can, but when we move it is most frequently because we either found a more accessible\\r\\nlocation or need more space. When SCALE moved close to the Los Angeles airport, the new location made it quite convenient\\r\\nfor someone from out of town to travel to our event. As a result, our attendance nearly doubled\\r\\nand we started to draw in attendees from around the country rather than just Southern\\r\\nCalifornia. Keep in mind that while having enough space is key, having too much space can also be a\\r\\nproblem. You want to find a venue that fits your program. For example, in 2006 we moved from\\r\\nthe Los Angeles Convention Center to a smaller hotel because we found that we were regularly\\r\\nlost in a sea of empty space, or crowded out by larger events. At a hotel we fit in better, and our\\r\\nneeds were taken more seriously by the venue staff as we were a sizable business for them. 502   CHAPTER FOURTEEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"91a13cd0-bdfd-4525-be76-770c88e26dc3":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"91a13cd0-bdfd-4525-be76-770c88e26dc3\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"jXLx3U4noBp1IkSLBQsri9nrvVmbjuZPFz/QZhlDWMA=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Ho/we75Yo/WaGUs1/D04e15NnySdf7atPng5OECxnh8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"d9017c12-9ee1-4bcf-ab68-c80f1780e456\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"KZxC4ODvsvNwCUt06IQLyStfDE9xFUuqAcli/x0L1Ig=\"}},\"hash\":\"76ilFN9KK/ieMkSwnl6KMAKYoAY1/NA0kQrokj4mukg=\",\"text\":\"Aside from space, what other considerations do you have for a venue, and what advice do you have for\\r\\nour readers? When we put together our annual request for proposals, other factors we keep in mind are:\\r\\nCost\\r\\nUnless your venue is donated, renting meeting space will likely be your largest expenditure. Make sure the venue fits your budget, and look for hidden costs. Even free venues may\\r\\nhave associated costs, such as requiring you to use their audio/visual or catering services. Layout\\r\\nAre your meeting rooms easy to find? How far are your meeting rooms from each other? It is important that it be easy to get between all of the rooms your event will use without\\r\\ngetting lost. If flow is not right, your event can either feel empty or feel overcrowded. Electrical power\\r\\nOne lesson we learned at the first SCALE was that electrical power is a requirement that\\r\\nneeds to be communicated clearly to a venue. We learned this the hard way, when one of\\r\\nour exhibitors turned on their rack of servers and tripped all of the breakers in the exhibit\\r\\nhall floor. If your venue is unsure of their circuit layout or how much power they can\\r\\nprovide, insist that they hire a third-party vendor to help. Most hotels and conference\\r\\ncenters know what their capabilities are, but you never know until you ask. Bandwidth\\r\\nSCALE attendees will use as much bandwidth as we can provide. Whether it be to blog\\r\\nabout the sessions they are in, contribute to a project in a hackathon/bug jam, or to\\r\\ndownload software they learn about in a session, they expect Internet service that works. Unfortunately, at many hotels or convention centers your attendees will likely be sharing\\r\\nan Internet connection with less bandwidth than they have at home. Internet connectivity\\r\\ncan also be expensive. We frequently encounter venues that will charge thousands of\\r\\ndollars to provide a single Ethernet port, charge per wireless/wired device, etc. If Internet\\r\\nconnectivity is important to your program, make sure to ask about these conditions up\\r\\nfront and consider them as you plan your budgets.

These days SCALE has built a reputation for itself that makes it significantly easier to attract\\r\\nspeakers. But even now there are speakers who elude us. We tend to work with our past\\r\\nattendees, speakers, and exhibitors to request introductions to speakers we would like to invite,\\r\\nor to provide references if we need them. Earlier in our history, we did not, however, have this advantage. To build our own reputation\\r\\nwe partnered with the University of Southern California’s (USC) computer science department.

SCALE is seen as one of the best open source community events in the United States. How have you\\r\\nmaintained the “community feel” of the event? I believe the largest contribution to the “community feel” is that the event is organized by the\\r\\ncommunity. New team members join every year to help with areas they feel they can improve. As a result, everyone who attends SCALE feels like they helped to make the event successful. Another contributing factor is that we make a strong effort to avoid undue influence by sponsors\\r\\nin our presentation selections or programming. We never allow product pitches in our\\r\\nconference program; these are reserved for our exhibit hall. And even in the exhibit hall we\\r\\nmake an effort to ensure both the community and commercial organizations are on equal\\r\\nfooting. At the start of each year, we allocate 50% of our exhibit space for use by nonprofit or community\\r\\norganizations, with the other 50% being designated for commercial use. There is no nonprofit\\r\\nzone: all of the groups are mixed in together. We then assign different team members to recruit\\r\\ncommercial and nonprofit exhibitors, ensuring that both types of exhibitor are well represented. This equal priority on both groups is key to our success. Commercial exhibitors pick up on the\\r\\ncommunity vibe from their neighbors and tailor their demos and messaging accordingly, and\\r\\nthe community exhibitors get just as much attention and foot traffic from attendees as our largest\\r\\ncommercial [exhibitors]. Finally, we build our schedule to allow attendees time to mingle and interact outside of formal\\r\\nprogramming. SCALE includes 30-minute breaks between our sessions to allow attendees to\\r\\nsocialize with each other, with speakers, and with exhibitors. Our attendees call this the hallway\\r\\ntrack, and tell us they often learn more during these breaks than they do during sessions.

Richard Esguerra, Humble Indie Bundle\\r\\nThe Humble Indie Bundle has been a unique force in presenting a collection of free games in\\r\\nwhich consumers are invited to contribute financially to support the project. The project has\\r\\nbeen hugely successful, earned impressive donations, and launched some fantastic games and\\r\\nthe careers of their developers. Richard works with game developers, nonprofits, and Humble Bundle customers to promote\\r\\nawesome, cross-platform video games and support vital causes. Every day he enjoys a healthy\\r\\nmix of email correspondence, social media interaction, and gameplay. The gaming community\\r\\nis notoriously tight, with creators and fans interacting quite closely, and every day brings an\\r\\nexciting new opportunity for Richard to develop the scene and catalyze changes in the overall\\r\\nindustry. Previously, Richard was an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, advocating for free\\r\\nspeech, privacy, and the spread of new business models for creators, where developing and\\r\\ninteracting with online communities was of vital importance in the work of defending digital\\r\\ncivil liberties. What is the history of the Humble Indie Bundle? Where did the idea come from? The cofounders of the Humble Indie Bundle originally headed up an indie game studio called\\r\\nWolfire Games, where they learned a lot about making games and the state of the industry. They\\r\\nhad an indie game called Lugaru, and they wanted to find a way to promote it alongside the\\r\\ngames made by their friends in the indie game community. They had assessed—as Cory\\r\\nDoctorow and others have said—that an independent creator’s number one challenge is\\r\\nobscurity.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a3fb82a0-f2e8-485b-a4db-880c0e276b98":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a3fb82a0-f2e8-485b-a4db-880c0e276b98\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"YB8GOz4Onmv4ZJTqxmtD8uV6k7wcnufVF0eswnMU2IE=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"76CtJOnEWcJNWN2HWSWF6kg08u8tplCHY3kEyz/lEfQ=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5e90c3b1-3def-43fb-b101-ebd4cdd24509\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"3joCLISS2LyRNU5kZ7bhm1HM5YT2Ii2MV/dC5R7r8yA=\"}},\"hash\":\"mvNcMQN7FtqtGwkVP+CKvGC7Yx5/kw3LnFC8d6u10oE=\",\"text\":\"As indie game developers and geeks themselves, they had observed various trends through sites\\r\\nlike Reddit, Slashdot, Ars Technica, and so on.

While at Wolfire Games, the cofounders built a focused community of gamers and developers\\r\\npassionate about creating and contributing to the dream games that they’ve always wanted. When they moved forward with the Humble Indie Bundle, I think that the cofounders more or\\r\\nless set out to create a community—out of the much broader community of PC gamers—that\\r\\nwould love and appreciate indie games. Now, the broader gaming world is starting to awaken\\r\\nto some of those ideas and take notice that indie games can be more adventurous than the typical\\r\\nmainstream hits. How did you encourage people to purchase and thus support the project? The Humble Indie Bundle was intended to be as compelling as possible by giving the gaming\\r\\ncommunity an almost unprecedented good deal: pay-what-you-want for several awesome\\r\\ngames, support indie game developers and worthwhile charities, and have complete control over\\r\\nhow your purchase dollars are distributed. They designed the site to be easy to use, and the\\r\\nfounders focused heavily on customer service, making sure that any potential customer would\\r\\nhave few to no barriers to deciding to participate. How did you track the success and growth of your community? We publish live stats during every promotion, which lets everyone know how things are going. It’s easy to see what the average price is, which platform’s users (Windows, Mac, or Linux) are\\r\\nthe most generous, and so on. In the past, Windows users have led the charge in terms of number\\r\\nof sales, but Linux users have been the most generous by far. Customers can sign up to receive email announcements when a new bundle goes live, so that’s\\r\\nbeen another way for us to know if gamers are excited about what we’re doing. We also lurk\\r\\nand post on Reddit, which is one of our favorite online communities. A lot of the posts seem\\r\\ngenuine, and the bad apples intent on derailing discussions seem to have less of an effect there. What opportunities and challenges have you faced with your community since the project started? Technical support is a pretty big challenge for each bundle.

The Mozilla community started to really gain momentum around the launch of Firefox 1.0. The first steps we took in building a Firefox community were bringing in a few very talented\\r\\nvolunteer engineers, Pierre Chanail, Mike Connor, Blake Ross, and others, to help us build a\\r\\ngreat product. No matter how passionate a community you have, if you don’t have a product\\r\\nthat makes a difference in users’ lives, you’re not going to achieve great success. But even with a great product, we were stuck if people didn’t know about it. At this point in\\r\\ntime, more people had come online after the death of Netscape than had ever been online during\\r\\nthe browser wars. However, most folks didn’t know what a browser was or how to download\\r\\nan alternative browser, presenting a challenge for us. How did you reach out to these folks? In the summer of 2004, Blake Ross and Asa Dotzler started an effort to reach out to bloggers\\r\\nwho were saying good things about Firefox and ask them to put up a “download Firefox” button\\r\\non their site. We needed to distribute the work to make an impact with this campaign, so Blake\\r\\nand Asa blogged, asking for volunteer help in building a tool to manage this process. That was\\r\\nthe beginning of Spread Firefox. Spread Firefox became the engagement hub for Mozilla—the first large-scale community-based\\r\\nmarketing effort the Web had ever seen. It grew to tens of thousands of members in just a few\\r\\nmonths and was the launch point for such campaigns as the New York Times Project, Firefox\\r\\nFlicks, and the Download Day campaign that set a Guinness Book record for most software\\r\\ndownloads in a single day. Mozilla has both a contributor and end-user community. What approaches have you used for\\r\\ngrowing both?

In January 2001, I decided to release the source code behind Drop.org as open source. I named\\r\\nit “Drupal,” as a play on the word druppel, which is Dutch for “drop. ” I didn’t have big plans for\\r\\nDrupal. I just wanted to share the code because people were interested. I expected maybe a\\r\\ndozen people would download and use it. In the early days I focused, completely and utterly, on the aesthetics of Drupal’s code. I spent\\r\\ndays trying to do something better, with fewer lines of code, and more elegant than elsewhere. For that reason, I didn’t care to maintain backward compatibility either. It felt is was the right\\r\\nthing to do. What kind of community did you set out to create? Early contributors to Drupal were developers. They fell in love with Drupal because it\\r\\nimplemented state-of-the-art web technologies, and it did so [in a cleaner], more flexible, and\\r\\nmore performant [way] than most other open source CMSes. I gave them free reign to\\r\\nimplement their ideas in the best possible way, even if that negatively impacted Drupal’s\\r\\nusability. How did these developers start collaborating with you and with one another? Initially, other developers would just email me patches. Then I set up a mailing list where we\\r\\nwould exchange patches. When that stopped scaling, we decided to use CVS to exchange\\r\\npatches. Eventually, we built our own bug tracking and code sharing tools on Drupal.org. Even today, the Drupal community is very developer-focused. I no longer think that is best for\\r\\na tool like Drupal, and so for many years many of us have been actively recruiting designers,\\r\\nusability experts, [and] information architects to Drupal. The best communities are well-\\r\\nrounded. How big is the Drupal community? It wasn’t until Drupal was four years old that I gave my first presentation about Drupal.

There are\\r\\nthousands of developers making a living with Drupal, and because of that they have a vested\\r\\ninterest in helping to maintain and advance Drupal. I don’t see Drupal’s growth stopping soon. First of all, the Web continues to expand. Second, in\\r\\na world where websites become increasingly complex, it becomes less and less attractive to\\r\\ndevelop a website when you can assemble one by leveraging thousands of modules. Open source\\r\\ncontent management systems are disrupting the traditional content management industry and\\r\\ndriving proprietary players to niche markets. All things combined, I think Drupal could easily\\r\\ngrow into a billion-dollar industry over the [coming] years. With a community as large as Drupal, how did you handle the scale as it grew? At each step in our growth, we had to scale all aspects of the project; our tools, our\\r\\nmethodologies, our infrastructure, our conferences, etc. Sometimes you can scale by automating\\r\\nthings or by creating more efficiencies in how you work, but more often you have to scale by\\r\\nbuilding a great team. You want to surround yourself with talented and passionate people,\\r\\nempower them, and transfer responsibilities to them. Then encourage them to do the same. When Drupal was small, I wrote all the code, read all the support questions, and managed the\\r\\ninfrastructure. Today, we have thousands of volunteers that contribute to different aspects of\\r\\nDrupal. I only review other people’s code and barely code myself, and I don’t think I can actually\\r\\nlog in to our servers anymore. It’s hard to let go of things that you are passionate about, but you\\r\\nhave to if you’re going to scale. This is true for everyone in the Drupal project, not just for me. How did you govern and manage the community as it scaled up? We govern the technical aspect from the project separately from the logistical aspects. For the logistical aspects, I cofounded the Drupal Association. The Drupal Association currently\\r\\nemploys more than five full-time staff [members].

At the time, most communication about the game came from Media Molecule’s\\r\\nown blog, as there were no official LBP destinations for reaching out to the players, other than\\r\\nsome outdated marketing sites—Flash-based media-heavy sites with no customer interactivity. 516   CHAPTER FOURTEEN\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"27044b10-db38-4e37-aff2-6ed0cdcb5808":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"27044b10-db38-4e37-aff2-6ed0cdcb5808\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"abFCIi7KLi2bb2RGt85dCWy2Agp7slQuNIyHHsM8QHM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"0xT8NegU3TnjOBdIgjKEG6xoDwciDkSzehiNH6ufols=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"50a4b21a-9383-4acb-af79-0996a2f572e1\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"Klv6zYoILgqFwiW0mghBzux9H1qg3pSBMY6FVmscVPs=\"}},\"hash\":\"xe8tJUKm1fUY0s6c/Y8J41s7HoFxqHHCki+OUxdaQgw=\",\"text\":\"As such, the community was quite spread out, and news seemed to come from many different\\r\\nsources. Our first steps were about [ensuring that] we had the basics of community covered: we\\r\\nreclaimed Littlebigplanet.com, and built a community-focused website for people to gather\\r\\naround—a place to get news, media, and support. We also needed to make sure we had a voice in various social media places, like Twitter and\\r\\nFacebook, and also within the established fan communities, so we could talk to people where\\r\\nthey were already hanging out. With all this in place, we could write news, talk to players, hold contests, and also we were able\\r\\nto start addressing a bigger and steadily growing issue... What issue was that? LittleBigPlanet is all about being able to create your own things and share them with others. The\\r\\naim was to bring creative people together, and to help people find great new things to play online. Before the game launched, the team had little idea just how successful it was going to be, if\\r\\nanyone would participate at all...It turned out to be far more successful than they ever\\r\\nenvisioned. Within six months over a million levels had been shared online. The systems\\r\\ndesigned to help people find the good stuff had only really been tested with hundreds of levels,\\r\\nnot millions, so they needed some urgent attention. We were able to help shape an improved set of in-game tools which we steadily built on and\\r\\nfinally completely overhauled for LittleBigPlanet 2. Additionally, though, we developed another\\r\\ncommunity destination to address the problem: LBP.me. LBP.me takes all the creations made in LittleBigPlanet and serves them onto the Web. Every\\r\\nplayer and every level has a unique short URL, complete with useful info like screenshots and\\r\\nreviews, plus the ability to queue a level for play when you next turn on the game. LBP.me\\r\\nmade sharing creations with others a lot easier, and combined with friend feeds, also available\\r\\nonline, it serves as a vital tool to help you find the levels you actually want to play amongst the\\r\\nnearly 6 million levels now available. How did you want to differentiate the LittleBigPlanet community from other online gaming communities? One of the main things I specifically wanted to ensure was that the community had a spirit that\\r\\nreflected that of the game: one of collaboration and sharing.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"50a4b21a-9383-4acb-af79-0996a2f572e1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"50a4b21a-9383-4acb-af79-0996a2f572e1\",\"metadata\":{},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"abFCIi7KLi2bb2RGt85dCWy2Agp7slQuNIyHHsM8QHM=\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"0xT8NegU3TnjOBdIgjKEG6xoDwciDkSzehiNH6ufols=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"27044b10-db38-4e37-aff2-6ed0cdcb5808\",\"metadata\":{},\"hash\":\"xe8tJUKm1fUY0s6c/Y8J41s7HoFxqHHCki+OUxdaQgw=\"}},\"hash\":\"Klv6zYoILgqFwiW0mghBzux9H1qg3pSBMY6FVmscVPs=\",\"text\":\"Lots of online communities can be very competitive, especially between different fan sites and\\r\\ngroups, and I wanted to try and have the spirit of sharing be the overwhelming feeling.

I think we achieved that quite well; community sites hold interlinking\\r\\ncontests, share resources, link to one another, and generally act friendly towards one another,\\r\\nso it feels like that worked for the most part. Of course, there are occasional feuds, but less so\\r\\nthan any other community I’ve worked with, for sure. A cute way we tried to encourage this at the start was by bringing back the web-ring, a forgotten\\r\\nfeature of the Web, and something that every website used to belong to. We gave it a twist,\\r\\nthough: the widget which you had to put onto your own site in order to be part of it would\\r\\nrecommend another random site for people to visit, and the index of all the sites was always\\r\\nrandom.

When someone creates something, [even] if a legal agreement means they lose ownership of it\\r\\nby uploading it to a server, they still perceive it as theirs; after all, they made it! A real challenge we’ve faced there is in the moderation service that takes down naughty levels. With the current moderation system, there is no communication between a player and the\\r\\nmoderator when their level is removed. Whilst lots of people will know exactly why their creation is gone, because they obviously broke\\r\\nthe rules, there are still cases where people do not understand what has happened to their level,\\r\\nand sadly won’t be able to find out either, which can, quite understandably, result in hurt\\r\\nfeelings. Ideally, I’d much prefer a more open solution, where people can easily get feedback on why\\r\\ntheir creation has been censored, and be able to talk to a real person about their problems and\\r\\nto find out how to fix them. What have been the main lessons learned throughout your experience of building the LittleBigPlanet\\r\\ncommunity? As a team we’ve learned a great deal about providing a service to people versus selling a game\\r\\nto people. Whilst LittleBigPlanet is a video game on a console, it’s also a platform for people to\\r\\nPlay, Create, and Share their own creations, and as such it needs to feature the same tools and\\r\\nservices that any similar platform, such as YouTube or Flickr, might provide. LittleBigPlanet is\\r\\nalso very similar to a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game in many aspects, and in an\\r\\nideal world would carry the same level of ongoing support and service that is common in the\\r\\nMMO world: more two-way support for player issues, fast bug fixing, etc. We’ve also learned lessons about how people relate to their creations, and share them. Once\\r\\nsomeone has spent 40 hours making something, they are going to be proud of it, and they will\\r\\nwant to share it with people, and show off.

I wanted to cover a diverse range of topics without bogging you down with impractical details\\r\\nand academic hand waving. With these goals in mind, I am proud of the outcome: I think The\\r\\nArt of Community provides the springboard to help you all build great communities. This is only the beginning, though. The French critic and poet Paul Valery once said, “A poem\\r\\nis never finished, only abandoned,” and the same can be said of this book. Community management, leadership, and organization is a new and young science. There is\\r\\nstill a long road ahead and many things to learn on the way. The first edition of The Art of\\r\\nCommunity was part one in an ongoing journey to document the art of building strong and\\r\\neffective communities.

As I settled into the brutal writing schedule, I was excited about the book, but\\r\\nI still felt like something was missing. Seemingly being someone who prefers to replace sleep\\r\\nfor heartburn, I decided there was one additional thing I wanted to work on: a central event\\r\\nand meeting place for community managers. Like many community managers, I had traveled around the world, trudging from conference\\r\\nto conference to talk up my communities, but I had little opportunity to sit down with other\\r\\ncommunity managers, including those from competing companies, to discuss our craft. Back\\r\\nthen, community management was still very much in its infancy, so I assumed the attendance\\r\\nwould be fairly small, and an intimate event could generate some really great discussion. And thus the Community Leadership Summit was born. From its humble beginnings in 2009,\\r\\nthe event has been run each year with over 200 attendees from a variety of different industries,\\r\\nprojects, perspectives, and backgrounds coming together to share ideas and best practices. The\\r\\nevent has even inspired other smaller, regional Community Leadership Summit events, too. Figure 15-1 is a group photo from the 2011 event. FIGURE 15-1.

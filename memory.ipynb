Did you know that the record for the most times a person has moved in their lifetime is 97 times? It was set by a woman named Jeanne Calment who lived to be 122 years old.\\nHuman: Wow, that's impressive. Do you know where she moved to?\\nAI: Yes, Jeanne Calment lived in France and most of her moves were within the city of Arles. She also spent some time living in Marseille and Paris.\""
